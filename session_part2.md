Session Summary — 1–2 short paragraphs.
The party hustled from Market Row toward the Hall of Records in Rigerton, keeping formation with Saylira up front, Akkad ushering, and Zadet bringing up the rear. City Guards saluted and passed along Captain Meredith’s interest in hiring the group to help with the Murder Crow problem.

At the Order of the Coin office, the group delivered the recovered ledger to Cirthus Dorne. Junior clerk Rena Vale recorded their account. Payment of 50 gold was made; the party discussed splitting coin while keeping Saylira as the business-facing lead. Plans to book travel to Three Rivers were reaffirmed.
