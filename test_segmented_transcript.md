### Segment 1 of 3

**[ASSIGN SPEAKER]:** I guess Solira can make a wisdom check as you're being assaulted by the sights and sounds of the waterfront. You don't notice anything out of the ordinary as you come upon the Gilded Thorn. And so, you see that it's a converted warehouse, but even though it was formerly a warehouse, you see that it's kind of has a gaudy opulent decor on the outside. You see parts of the wood frame kind of painted with a gold paint. And from within, you can hear song and clapping and various sounds of people enjoying themselves. Well, since this isn't official business, I'll go ahead and open the door for myself. Okay. Oh, no, no, no, she's not. I'm about to open the door for myself and Zahra rushes forward. And open for you. As the door swings open, you notice both on the outside where Zahra opened the door as well as immediately on the inside, you see some burly looking maybe bouncers or security kind of stationed on either side of the double doors that allow entrance into the Gilded Thorn. As you go up the steps and enter, the door opens into a wide open area with high rafters where the rafters are all painted gold with various chandeliers hanging, fueled by candles and supported by a sequence of ropes and pulleys where the chandeliers can be lowered to be lit and then raised up high above to help illuminate. As the candlelight flickers off the golden beams, it cascades kind of a warm glow over the interior of the warehouse. On one end of the warehouse, you see a stage where there's some musicians playing. There's various tables scattered here and there. You see an area where folks are swaying and dancing to the music. And then there's another part of the warehouse which you can't see where long elaborate drapes kind of cascade from the ceiling down to the floor, kind of separating and partitioning off a whole section of the warehouse where you can't see. And near the front, as you step down the stairs onto the main floor, there's a greeter or proprietor who greets you. He's grinning. He's wearing an eyepatch. And he welcomes you to the Gilded Thorn. And he calls himself Bemro. Uncle Bemro. Did you say arg? No. He says, Uncle Bemro welcomes you to the Gilded Thorn. Please enter, enter and enjoy yourself. Whether you seek to enter new contracts, enjoy the drink and food, or entertainment, everyone here at the Gilded Thorn is here to serve you. And should you wish to have a private room, just come see me and ask. And he kind of opens he holds his left arm welcomingly, palm open as he ushers you further onto the floor of the Gilded Thorn. You see various tables both occupied and empty. There's many patrons here of various mercantile guilds dressed according to their stature. You see some that are very well decked out, others more practically so, though their clothing might be practical is by no means basic, right? It's good quality, exceptional dyed cloths with glinting fasteners, you know, whether they're silver buttons or other ornamentation. Some with fancy embroidery on velvet cloth, right? Many wearing elegant footwear. Not as to say that some aren't wearing more practical footwear like calf high boots, but even so, right, they seem to be well crafted and adorned. What does Sylera and Zodit do after they've surveyed the scene? Well, does Sylera recognize anybody? It takes a bit for you to absorb everything that's going on, and so while you're deciding what to do, we'll flip back to Parun and Orokod. So Parun is speaking with Mother Gaul. So she asked him to speak plainly, and in response, Parun slightly bows, and this small smirk on his face, kind of recognizing where she's coming from, it's like, tell me then, Mother Gaul, what do you see of the murder crows near the water's edge? Their seals, they mark the trees, their whispers stir the mist. What are they watching? What do they serve, or who do they serve? What in turn watches them? And he's got that piece of, what is it, bitter root or something, like, and he's holding it to her, and he sort of kind of adds very softly, I ask for my companion's sake. We would not walk blindly into their talons. And so she reaches out with your hand, and it seems like the root that you offered her just kind of fades from your grasp as she tucks her hand back within the folds of her dress, seemingly having captured your offering to her without much effort, but also without you noticing exactly how she ended up grasping hold of it. And she says that the murder crows serve themselves, and perhaps a higher purpose, she says. They are currently in Brigerton, in conflict with the order of the coin, as well as with the local commerce, as she smirks, in kind of a knowing fashion, and she says that though the murder crows are attempting to establish a more permanent foothold within Brigerton, they have desires and aims beyond. And she says there's whispers of a race to the sunken mint, of which I suspect you already know and may even be a part of. So not much information that we didn't already know. Let's see, sort of nods at her. She's thinking. And then she says, almost as if reading your mind, and says, but perhaps you are here as emissaries of the guard or perhaps the order of the coin themselves to deal with the murder crow incursion upon Brigerton. If that is your aim, ask away. Ask away. Hmm, okay. Okay, so Prune's very intrigued. He straightens up. He's very intrigued that Mother Gull seems to sort of see through the surface questions and and he's a little concerned because her mentioning the guard and the order of the coin makes him think maybe they have been seen more closely than they realize, but so he lowers his voice sort of conspiratorially, but you know, it's like we are not emissaries nor coin counting lackeys, but the crows we have crossed paths. We mean

### Segment 2 of 3

**[ASSIGN SPEAKER]:** to understand their presence here, to know what they seek, not just in Brigerton, but in the depths beneath. So tell me, Mother Gull, where do they roost? Who among them wears red feathers and what folk here might feed them scraps? She says the crows are led by a triumvirate whom you probably already know by name and she says, kind of poking her chin towards the northeast, they roost in Shanty Row and they frequent. You say Shanty Row? Yeah, which basically is the. That place of huts or whatever over there? That place of huts or whatever over there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And she says, but seek no further than the rain barrel. Which rain barrel is that? Now who's speaking in riddles? The green pin just to the northeast of. Ah, the brothel. Which one? It's a brothel, it's called the rain barrel. Oh, I see, I see. Is that all she says? Yeah. She she basically told you that that's that's a place where they roost. Probably where they. Yeah. Yeah. And that's kind of. Kind of a way to somehow. Probably where they operate out of. You suspect that though it's it's a pleasure house. The the murder crows have been able to either take control or subvert that the the house or have something over the the matron of the rain barrel in order to use that kind of as a base of operations. And mother mother gall tells you yes seek no further than the rain barrel. For her her matron is beneath their thumb. She says I suspect that she would be ever so thankful. Uh should should you free her. Of them. Um. So. His response he says um. So a triumvirate uh who would uh bind the flesh of this place under their feathered seal. And a brothel matron made their puppet. Indeed indeed she repeats. So he and he nods to himself. The rain barrel may spill more than ale and sweat. If she is truly beneath their thumb. Perhaps there's perhaps she's the crack in their talons grip. And he smiles a bit. Mother gall you've stirred the pot well. If you hear more. If the orphans find things they should not. Have them whisper it to the shadows. I will be listening. And um and he drops so he pulls from a pouch. A scrap of a a bent surgical pick um which is engraved engraved with the symbol of shun. Um uh a little small token into the stew pot like a token of his thanks. And he turns away and steps back out into the steam and vanishes. Okay. Okay. Um. Okay so perun was able to get some information from mother gall. A cod um I think was um. He was watching the um the crate crawl. The crate crawl. Yeah so it's obvious that um either you have an invitation or you have uh knowledge of a password. Um to be able to get past the the entryway into the crate crawl. And um it seems like uh the invitation takes the form of um a coin. Any coin? You don't you can't get a close enough look but you you see people flashing a coin. Um to be able to get in. And if they don't have a coin you you you see them whispering something. So he's going to be looking um if anybody seems to be approaching it. Like they want anybody who's going to be entering the place. So he is going to um whichever one he identifies as being the most likely mark. Uh he is going to um do the classic uh uh thieves um street rogue uh brush past pickpocket. Um lift the coin from that person. Bump and roll. That's right. Bump and roll as if you were a drunk. Excuse me sir. I didn't see you there. Or you yell at him. Well watch it you. Okay. So you you spend some time uh observing and trying to identify an appropriate mark. Um you all you notice though that people don't just make a beeline uh to the entrance. You find them um kind of appear out of nowhere. Um um primarily along the alleyway here. Buildings before they they get to uh the entrance of the crate crawl. Um that's where a majority of people approach the entrance. They don't like go down the road and make a beeline. Um so unless unless you're taking position up in the alley um it's unlikely you'll get be able to get close enough to someone that's that's obviously approaching the the crate crawl. Yeah he's gonna move himself into the alley and sort of being um you know in the shadows maybe leaning up against a barrel and you know kind of looking uh drunk um muttering to himself and if a likely mark sort of comes past down the alley he stumbles forward and bumps into them. So I'm sorry. Okay. Uh which is which is actually uh not too bad because um aside from the warehouse underneath which the crate crawl um provides access the entryway um the surrounding buildings there's a barrel right right next to the warehouse and then there's the ironworks across the street. So there's um even in uh the early evening um there's sounds of anvils uh and hammering um and basically sounds emanating from the the workhouses that are uh in proximity. Um though as you make your way towards the the alleyway between uh the barrel right and the warehouse um you see a burly um figure kind of standing at the the entrance of the alleyway um staring at you as you approach. Staring he's in the entryway of the alley? Yeah he's basically on on the kind of the outer edge uh of the alleyway. Um he he's in within the alley but on the edge right and so uh you have to have you have to pass him um to get into the alleyway further to get further into the alleyway. Okay um I mean does it look like people are doing anything special to get past him or is he just letting people go? Um so you observe um that

### Segment 3 of 3

**[ASSIGN SPEAKER]:** from from this angle you observe that there's a special hand sign that's given um and um if the hand sign is not given he uh basically shoes people away from the alley. So in his observations has Akai been able to learn this hand sign? Can he can he deliver it? Um he he thinks he can. Um he he's observed it a few times um kind of from perhaps off off by the the crates kind of peering between the crates to to witness uh the approach. Um some people who come down towards the alleyway are shoed off and they continue down the side of the warehouse um and for folks that disappear into the alleyway they seem to make um a hand signal uh which Prune um is able to witness a few times. And so he um it's it's a hand gesture that's made with both hands. So he's going to be posing as somewhat tipsy um so that he might not completely you know be able to pull this off you know because he's a bit drunk you know but he's going to his typical haunt and he's like oh yeah. And he approaches it and um um comes up to this person as he's walking down the alley and just like and then delivers the sign the best he can. Okay so make a uh dexterity check. Be like trip a little bit as he's doing it. Oh yeah. Okay you managed to pull off the the the hand the the double hand gesture you know you combine your your fingers and and you know twist your hands around you know as kind of kind of reminiscent of here's a church here's a steeple here's all the people you know kind of gesture and um you you are um given uh access to the alleyway. All right so he's going to continue moving down the alleyway and find a an appropriate spot where he can um you know set himself up to do the bump and roll and lift a coin. Okay so do you want to be closer to the entryway or closer to the entryway to the alleyway or no? I think he's going to want to be like somewhere there's like a little niche here maybe like in this kind of area so someplace I mean he's going to want to stay somewhat hidden but in a location where he could sort of stumble and it's like oh okay so so right about kind of midway in the alleyway there's there's various um crates and and iron rings and whatnot used in uh barrel making that are kind of stacked along the wall of the workhouse um and so um so you're able to kind of find a uh kind of a partially obscured uh location uh behind uh some of the the the boards um that have yet to be prepared uh to be fitted in in into a barrel and uh you lay in wait um for an inappropriate uh target so we we can switch back to Salier and Zottit um as they survey their surroundings within the gilded thorn gilded thorn um yeah so basically I want to find a group to approach and strike up a conversation with but if I if I see someone that I recognize then that would be an easy entry okay um so I would also call out that it's almost 9 30. Yes it is so we can pause here um and then resume um sometime because I think two weeks from now Debs and I will be on our way to Connecticut and I will be in uh North Carolina and Tennessee that week oh okay um do we want to try to meet in a week I think I could do that I'm good for that okay or should be okay so let's let's pencil in um next Friday and then we'll have a little bit of a hiatus um maybe I don't know if it's two weeks by then I think James will be um have have made the the the trip right yep uh I actually fly out the third so yep okay okay uh assuming that the uh TSA and AGC yeah yeah that's also assuming our flights aren't affected by the closures as well yeah um oh that's right yeah so we'll we'll hope for the best and we'll um we'll suspend for now um maybe if you want to run the the transcripts through again um that would be helpful yep and we'll try to use my new um transcription agent okay cool um additional data points for testing um and we'll see we'll see everyone um again on Friday and then hopefully dim sum or buffet that Saturday good that's good okay so have a have a good week hope for the shutdown to end indeed all right if if yeah um have a good week folks okay all right you too okay good week good week all right I was going to bring up the stars and wishes oh with the other group um if you look on discord in the text channels under general okay there's a link at the bottom that says stars and wishes it's a little um facebook video um of an idea it's it's similar to like an agile retrospective um where stars you can award uh to the other players uh for things that you appreciate uh during the session and then wishes are things that um we you know that that you'd like to have seen or or see in the future sessions um so um we didn't we didn't do this and with the last session of the other group um uh I think we watched it we thought it might be interesting to try uh we don't have to do it this time but um if you want to watch the video and think about um that suggestion for for at the end of next session um we can try it if you think it might be fun to do sounds cool okay and with that we'll say good night good night everyone have a great week all right good night
