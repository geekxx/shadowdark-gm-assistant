## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Speaker Label Consistency

**üéØ IMPORTANT: Each segment gets independent speaker IDs!**

- Speaker_1 in this segment ‚â† Speaker_1 in other segments
- The same person might be Speaker_1 here, Speaker_3 elsewhere
- **YOU MUST standardize names before merging transcripts**

**‚úèÔ∏è Fix Speaker Names NOW (before merging):**
1. Replace Speaker_1, Speaker_2, etc. with consistent names:
   - GM ‚Üí GM (always the same)
   - Speaker_1 ‚Üí Alice (if Alice is speaking)
   - Speaker_2 ‚Üí Bob (if Bob is speaking)
   - etc.
2. Listen to a few seconds if you need to identify voices

## Additional Editing Instructions

**After fixing speaker names, also review:**

1. **Fix Transcription Errors**: Correct any misheard words or phrases
2. **Add Context**: Include important non-verbal actions in [brackets]
3. **Clean Up**: Remove filler words, false starts, and off-topic conversation
4. **Preserve Game Content**: Keep all in-character dialogue and game mechanics

**Formatting Guidelines:**
- Use consistent names: **GM**, **Alice**, **Bob**, etc.
- Use [dice roll], [pause], [laughter] for non-verbal content
- Mark unclear sections with [unclear] for follow-up

## Transcript

### 00:03 - 00:04
**GM:** I

### 00:08 - 00:20
**GM:** guess Solira can make a wisdom check as you're being assaulted by the sights and sounds of the waterfront. You don't notice anything

### 00:21 - 00:30
**GM:** out of the ordinary as you come upon the Gilded Thorn. And so you see that it's

### 00:32 - 00:34
**GM:** a converted warehouse, but

### 00:37 - 00:39
**GM:** even though it

### 00:41 - 00:43
**GM:** was formerly a

### 00:44 - 00:59
**GM:** warehouse, you see that it's kind of has a gaudy opulent decor on the outside. You see parts of the wood frame kind of painted with a gold paint.

### 01:01 - 01:11
**GM:** And from within, you can hear song and clapping and various sounds of people enjoying themselves. Well, since this

### 01:13 - 01:14
**GM:** is

### 01:15 - 01:19
**GM:** an official business, I'll go

### 01:21 - 01:32
**GM:** ahead and open the door for myself. Okay. Oh, no, no, no, she's not. I'm about to open the door for

### 01:33 - 01:37
**Player 2:** myself and Zahra rushes forward. And

### 01:39 - 01:41
**GM:** open for you. As

### 01:41 - 01:48
**Player 2:** the door swings open, you notice both on the outside where Zahra

### 01:48 - 01:50
**GM:** opened the door, as

### 01:53 - 02:07
**GM:** well as immediately on the inside, you see some burly looking maybe bouncers or security kind of stationed on either side of the double doors that allow

### 02:09 - 02:09
**GM:** entrance

### 02:11 - 02:25
**GM:** into the Gilded Thorn. As you go up the steps and enter, the door opens into a wide open area with high rafters where the rafters

### 02:26 - 02:47
**GM:** are all painted gold with various chandeliers hanging, fueled by candles supported by a sequence of ropes and pulleys where the chandeliers can be lowered to be lit and then raised up high above to help illuminate. As the candlelight

### 02:48 - 03:18
**GM:** flickers off the golden beams, it cascades kind of a warm glow over the interior of the warehouse. On one end of the warehouse, you see a stage where there's some musicians playing. There's various tables scattered here and there. You see an area where folks are swaying and dancing to the music. And then there's another part

### 03:19 - 03:26
**GM:** of the warehouse which you can't see where long elaborate drapes kind of cascade from

### 03:28 - 03:43
**GM:** the ceiling down to the floor, kind of separating and partitioning off a whole section of the warehouse where you can't see. And near the front, as you step down

### 03:49 - 04:11
**GM:** the stairs onto the main floor, there's a greeter or proprietor who greets you. He's grinning. He's wearing an eyepatch. And he welcomes you to the Gilded Thorn. And he calls himself Bemro. Uncle Bemro. Did you say arg? No. He says,

### 04:13 - 04:24
**GM:** Uncle Bemro welcomes you to the Gilded Thorn. Please enter, enter and enjoy yourself. Whether you seek to enter new contracts,

### 04:26 - 04:33
**GM:** enjoy the drink and food, or entertainment, everyone here at the Gilded Thorn

### 04:33 - 04:54
**GM:** is here to serve you. And should you wish to have a private room, just come see me and ask. And he kind of opens he holds his left arm welcomingly, palm open as he ushers you further onto

### 04:58 - 05:02
**GM:** the floor of the Gilded Thorn. You

### 05:03 - 05:20
**GM:** see various tables both occupied and empty. There's many patrons here of various mercantile guilds dressed according to their stature. You see some that are very well decked out, others more practically

### 05:23 - 05:30
**GM:** so, though their clothing might be practical is by no means basic, right? It's good

### 05:33 - 05:55
**GM:** quality, exceptional dyed cloths with glinting fasteners, you know, whether they're silver buttons or other ornamentation. Some with fancy embroidery on velvet cloth, right? Many wearing elegant footwear. Not as to say that some aren't wearing more practical footwear like calf high boots.

### 05:57 - 06:25
**GM:** But even so, right, they seem to be well crafted and adorned. What does Sylera and Zodit do after they've surveyed the scene? Well, does Sylera recognize anybody? It takes a bit for you to absorb everything that's going on. And so while you're deciding what to do, we'll flip back to Parun and Orokod.

### 06:27 - 06:31
**GM:** So Parun is speaking with Mother Ghaul. So

### 06:32 - 06:59
**GM:** she asked him to speak plainly. And in response, Parun slightly bows, and a small smirk on his face, kind of recognizing what she's, you know, where she's coming from, it's like, tell me then, Mother Ghaul, what do you see of the murder crows near the water's edge? Their seals, they

### 07:01 - 07:27
**GM:** mark the trees, their whispers stir the mist. What are they watching? What do they serve? Or who do they serve? What in turn watches them? And he's got that piece of, what is it, bitter root or something, like, and he's holding it to her. And he sort of kind

### 07:28 - 07:30
**Player 2:** of adds very

### 07:32 - 07:43
**GM:** softly, I ask for my companion's sake. We would not walk blindly into their talons. And so she reaches out with your hand.

### 07:46 - 07:51
**Player 1:** And it seems like the root that you

### 07:53 - 08:02
**Player 1:** offered her just kind of fades from your grasp as she tucks her hand back within

### 08:03 - 08:14
**Player 1:** the folds of her dress, seemingly having captured your offering to her without much effort, but also without you noticing

### 08:15 - 08:20
**Player 1:** exactly how she ended up grasping hold of it. And

### 08:21 - 08:28
**Player 1:** she says that the murder crows serve themselves and perhaps a higher

### 08:34 - 08:35
**GM:** purpose,

### 08:35 - 08:47
**Player 1:** she says. They are currently in Brigerton in conflict with the order of the coin, as well as with the local

### 08:47 - 08:50
**Player 1:** commerce, as she smirks,

### 08:52 - 08:54
**GM:** in kind

### 08:55 - 09:21
**GM:** of a knowing fashion. And she says that though the murder crows are attempting to establish a more permanent foothold within Brigerton, they have desires and aims beyond. And she says there's whispers of a race to the sunken mint, of which I suspect you already know and may even

### 09:22 - 09:32
**GM:** be a part of. So not much information that we didn't already know. Let's see, sort of nods at

### 09:33 - 09:38
**GM:** her, thinking. And then she says, almost as if

### 09:39 - 09:39
**GM:** reading

### 09:41 - 09:54
**GM:** your mind, and says, but perhaps you are here as emissaries of the guard. Or perhaps the order of the coin themselves to deal with

### 09:56 - 10:03
**GM:** the murder crow incursion upon Brigerton. If that is your aim, ask away. Okay.

### 10:06 - 10:09
**GM:** Okay, so Prune's very intrigued. He

### 10:12 - 10:15
**GM:** straightens up. He's very intrigued that Mother

### 10:16 - 10:25
**GM:** Gull seems to sort of see through the surface questions, and he's a little concerned

### 10:28 - 10:33
**GM:** because her mentioning the guard and the order

### 10:34 - 10:47
**GM:** of the coin makes him think maybe they have been seen more closely than they realize. So he lowers his voice, sort of conspiratorially,

### 10:49 - 10:56
**GM:** but, you know, it's like, we are not emissaries nor coin-counting lackeys, but the

### 10:58 - 11:01
**GM:** crows, we have crossed paths.

### 11:02 - 11:03
**GM:** We

### 11:05 - 11:09
**GM:** mean to understand their presence here, to know

### 11:12 - 11:13
**Player 1:** what

### 11:15 - 11:21
**Player 1:** they seek, not just in Brigerton, but in the depths

### 11:24 - 11:26
**Player 1:** beneath. So tell me,

### 11:32 - 11:32
**Player 1:** Mother

### 11:36 - 11:47
**GM:** Gull, where do they roost? Who among them wears red feathers, and what folk here might feed them scraps? And she

### 11:49 - 11:52
**GM:** says, the crows are led by

### 11:54 - 12:05
**GM:** a triumvirate, whom you probably already know by name. And she says, kind of poking her chin towards the northeast, they roost

### 12:07 - 12:11
**GM:** in Shanty Row, and they frequent... Did

### 12:13 - 12:14
**GM:** you say

### 12:21 - 12:23
**Player 1:** Shanty Row? Yeah, which

### 12:26 - 12:29
**Player 1:** basically is the... That place

### 12:32 - 12:36
**Player 1:** of huts or whatever over there?

### 12:37 - 12:38
**Player 1:** Yeah,

### 12:39 - 12:46
**Player 1:** yeah. And she says, but seek no further than the rain barrel.

### 12:47 - 12:48
**Player 1:** Which

### 12:50 - 13:05
**Player 1:** rain barrel is that? Now who's speaking in riddles? The green pin just to the northeast of... Oh, the brothel. Which one? It's a brothel. It's called the

### 13:06 - 13:09
**GM:** rain barrel. Oh, I see, I

### 13:11 - 13:17
**Player 1:** see. Is that all she says? Yeah, she basically told you

### 13:25 - 13:27
**Player 1:** that that's a place

### 13:28 - 13:33
**Player 1:** where they roost, probably where they operate out

### 13:36 - 13:37
**GM:** of.

### 13:41 - 13:45
**GM:** You suspect that though it's a

### 13:46 - 13:52
**GM:** pleasure house, the murder crows have been able to either take

### 13:54 - 13:55
**GM:** control

### 13:58 - 14:07
**GM:** or subvert the house, or have something over the matron of the rain barrel in order to use

### 14:10 - 14:13
**GM:** that kind of as a base

### 14:15 - 14:19
**GM:** of operations. And Mother Gull tells you, yes,

### 14:23 - 14:23
**Player 1:** seek

### 14:26 - 14:27
**Player 1:** no

### 14:28 - 14:37
**GM:** further than the rain barrel for her matron is beneath their thumb. Okay. She says, I suspect

### 14:41 - 14:42
**Player 1:** that she

### 14:48 - 14:48
**Player 2:** would

### 14:48 - 14:55
**GM:** be ever so thankful should you free her of them. So, his

### 14:57 - 14:57
**GM:** response,

### 15:01 - 15:02
**Player 1:** he

### 15:03 - 15:05
**Player 1:** says, So,

### 15:03 - 15:05
**Player 2:** a triumvirate who would

### 15:06 - 15:08
**Player 1:** bind the flesh

### 15:20 - 15:27
**GM:** of this place under their feathered seal, and a brothel matron made their puppet.

### 15:29 - 15:41
**GM:** Indeed, indeed, she repeats. And he nods to himself. The rain barrel may spill more than ale and sweat. If she is truly

### 15:42 - 15:45
**GM:** beneath their thumb, perhaps she's

### 15:47 - 16:07
**GM:** the crack in their talons grip. And he smiles a bit. Mother Gull, you've stirred the pot well. If you hear more, if the orphans find things they should not, have them whisper it to the shadows. I will be

### 16:09 - 16:12
**GM:** listening. And he drops, so

### 16:13 - 16:17
**GM:** he pulls from a pouch, a scrap

### 16:18 - 16:22
**GM:** of a bent surgical pick, which is

### 16:24 - 16:26
**GM:** engraved with the

### 16:28 - 16:32
**GM:** symbol of Shun, a little small token

### 16:33 - 16:36
**GM:** into the stew pot, like

### 16:39 - 16:40
**Player 1:** a token

### 16:43 - 16:44
**GM:** of

### 16:45 - 16:50
**GM:** his thanks. And he turns away and steps back

### 16:51 - 16:52
**GM:** out

### 16:53 - 16:55
**GM:** into the steam

### 17:09 - 17:10
**GM:** and vanishes

### 17:13 - 17:15
**Player 1:** back to the alleys.

### 17:20 - 17:23
**Player 1:** Okay. Okay, so Perun was

### 17:25 - 17:31
**Player 1:** able to get some information from Mother Gull. Akkad, I think,

### 17:33 - 17:35
**Player 1:** was... He was watching

### 17:37 - 17:37
**Player 1:** the

### 17:41 - 17:43
**GM:** crate crawl. The crate

### 17:44 - 17:51
**Player 1:** crawl. Yeah, so it's obvious that either you have an invitation or you

### 17:52 - 18:01
**Player 1:** have knowledge of a password to be able to get past the entryway into the crate crawl.

### 18:03 - 18:08
**Player 1:** And it seems like the invitation takes the form

### 18:09 - 18:13
**Player 1:** of a coin. Any coin? You can't get

### 18:14 - 18:18
**Player 1:** a close enough look, but you see

### 18:19 - 18:23
**Player 1:** people flashing a coin. To be able

### 18:24 - 18:38
**Player 1:** to get in. And if they don't have a coin, you see them whispering something. So he's going to be looking, if anybody seems to

### 18:47 - 18:47
**Player 1:** be

### 18:49 - 18:50
**GM:** approaching

### 18:51 - 18:58
**GM:** it, like they want, anybody who's going to be entering the place,

### 19:02 - 19:03
**GM:** so

### 19:04 - 19:06
**Player 1:** he is going to,

### 19:06 - 19:08
**GM:** whichever one he

### 19:12 - 19:14
**GM:** identifies as being

### 19:16 - 19:29
**GM:** the most likely mark, he is going to do the classic thieves, street rogue, brush past, pickpocket, lift the coin from that person. Bump

### 19:29 - 19:41
**GM:** and roll. That's right. Bump and roll as if you were a drunk. Excuse me, sir. I didn't see you there. Or

### 19:43 - 19:44
**GM:** you

### 19:51 - 19:53
**GM:** yell at him. Watch it,

### 19:56 - 19:57
**Player 1:** you!

### 19:58 - 20:03
**GM:** Okay. So you spend some time observing and trying

### 20:04 - 20:11
**Player 1:** to identify an appropriate mark. You notice, though, that people don't just make

### 20:13 - 20:20
**Player 1:** a beeline to the entrance. You find them kind of appear out

### 20:21 - 20:39
**Player 1:** of nowhere. Primarily along the alleyway here. Buildings before they get to the entrance of the crate crawl. That's where a majority of people approach the entrance. They don't go down the road and

### 20:41 - 20:45
**GM:** make a beeline. So, unless you're taking

### 20:46 - 20:49
**GM:** position up in the alley,

### 20:53 - 20:58
**GM:** it's unlikely you'll be able to get close enough to

### 21:04 - 21:04
**GM:** someone

### 21:08 - 21:18
**GM:** that's obviously approaching the crate crawl. Yeah, he's going to move himself into the alley and sort of being, you

### 21:19 - 21:31
**GM:** know, in the shadows, maybe leaning up against a barrel, and, you know, kind of looking drunk, muttering to himself. And if a

### 21:32 - 21:36
**GM:** likely mark sort of comes past down

### 21:37 - 21:49
**GM:** the alley, he stumbles forward and bumps into them. Sorry. Okay. Which is actually not too bad because, aside from the warehouse underneath

### 21:53 - 21:59
**GM:** which the crate crawl provides access, the entryway, the surrounding buildings, there's

### 22:02 - 22:09
**GM:** a barrel right next to the warehouse, and then there's the ironworks across

### 22:10 - 22:18
**Player 1:** the street. So there's, even in the early evening, there's sounds of anvils and hammering, and

### 22:31 - 22:34
**GM:** basically sounds emanating from the workhouses

### 22:36 - 22:37
**GM:** that

### 22:42 - 23:19
**GM:** are in proximity. Though, as you make your way towards the alleyway between the barrel right and the warehouse, you see a burly figure kind of standing at the entrance of the alleyway, staring at you as you approach. Staring? He's in the entryway of the alley? Yeah, he's basically on the outer edge of the alleyway. He's within the alley, but on the edge, right? And so you have to pass

### 23:20 - 23:21
**GM:** him

### 23:22 - 23:31
**GM:** to get into the alleyway further, to get further into the alleyway. Okay. I mean, does it

### 23:33 - 23:52
**GM:** look like people are doing anything special to get past him, or is he just letting people go? So you observe that, from this angle, you observe that there's a special hand sign that's given. And

### 23:54 - 23:56
**GM:** if the hand

### 23:58 - 24:01
**Player 1:** sign's not given, he

### 24:01 - 24:06
**GM:** basically shoos people away from the alley. So

### 24:07 - 24:10
**GM:** in his observations, has Akai been

### 24:11 - 24:15
**GM:** able to learn this hand sign? Can he

### 24:16 - 24:26
**GM:** deliver it? He thinks he can. He's observed it a few times, kind of from, perhaps off by

### 24:33 - 24:34
**Player 1:** the

### 24:38 - 24:40
**GM:** crates, kind of peering

### 24:41 - 24:59
**GM:** between the crates to witness the approach. Some people who come down towards the alleyway are shooed off and they continue down the side of the warehouse. And for folks that disappear into the

### 25:01 - 25:09
**Player 1:** alleyway, they seem to make a hand signal, which Prune is able to witness

### 25:11 - 25:13
**GM:** a few

### 25:15 - 25:16
**GM:** times.

### 25:18 - 25:24
**GM:** And so it's a hand gesture that's made with both hands.

### 25:25 - 25:26
**GM:** So

### 25:30 - 25:47
**GM:** he's going to be posing as somewhat tipsy so that he might not completely, you know, be able to pull this off, you know, because he's a bit drunk, you know, but

### 25:49 - 26:05
**GM:** he's going to his typical haunt and he's like, oh, yeah. And he approaches it and comes up to this person as he's walking down the alley and just like, and

### 26:07 - 26:10
**GM:** then delivers the sign the best

### 26:12 - 26:17
**Player 1:** he can. Okay. So make a dexterity check. Like

### 26:18 - 26:20
**Player 1:** trip a little bit as

### 26:21 - 26:28
**Player 1:** he's doing it. Oh, yeah. Okay. You managed to pull off the double

### 26:30 - 26:41
**Player 1:** hand gesture. You know, you combine your fingers and, you know, twist your hands around, you know, kind of reminiscent of, here's a

### 26:42 - 26:45
**GM:** church, here's a steeple. Here

### 26:48 - 26:49
**GM:** are

### 26:51 - 27:06
**GM:** all the people, you know, kind of gesture. And you are given access to the alleyway. All right. So he's going to continue moving down the alleyway and

### 27:08 - 27:09
**Player 1:** find

### 27:09 - 27:18
**GM:** an appropriate spot where he can, you know, set himself up to do the bump and roll

### 27:19 - 27:22
**GM:** and lift a coin. Okay.

### 27:22 - 27:36
**Player 1:** So do you want to be closer to the entryway or closer to, the entryway to the alleyway or? No, I think he's going to

### 27:36 - 27:47
**GM:** want to be like, there's like a little niche here, maybe like in this kind of area. So someplace, I mean,

### 27:50 - 27:51
**GM:** he's going

### 27:54 - 27:56
**Player 1:** to want to stay

### 28:05 - 28:16
**GM:** somewhat hidden, but in a location where he could sort of stumble and it's like, oh. Okay. So right about kind of

### 28:20 - 28:34
**GM:** midway in the alleyway, there's various crates and iron rings and whatnot used in barrel making that are kind of stacked along the wall of the workhouse. And

### 28:37 - 28:53
**GM:** so you're able to kind of find a, kind of a partially obscured location behind some of the boards that have yet to be prepared to be fitted into a

### 28:55 - 29:00
**GM:** barrel. And you lay in wait for an inappropriate target.

### 29:01 - 29:07
**GM:** So we can switch back to Salir and Zadet as they

### 29:09 - 29:14
**GM:** survey their surroundings within the Gilded Thorn. So basically I want

### 29:16 - 29:17
**GM:** to find

### 29:28 - 29:28
**GM:** a

### 29:30 - 29:30
**GM:** group

### 29:32 - 29:34
**GM:** to approach and strike up

### 29:35 - 29:36
**Player 1:** a

### 29:38 - 29:46
**GM:** conversation with, but if I see someone that I recognize, then that would be an

### 29:48 - 29:56
**GM:** easy entry. Okay. So I would also call out that it's almost 930. Yes, it

### 29:58 - 30:04
**Player 1:** is. So we can pause here and then resume sometime because

### 30:05 - 30:09
**GM:** I think two weeks from now, Debs and I

### 30:18 - 30:19
**Player 1:** will be

### 30:20 - 30:24
**GM:** on our way to Connecticut. And I

### 30:27 - 30:35
**GM:** be in North Carolina and Tennessee that week. Oh, okay. Do we want to try

### 30:36 - 30:40
**GM:** to meet in a week? I

### 30:41 - 30:42
**GM:** think

### 30:44 - 30:47
**Player 1:** I could do that. I'm good

### 30:53 - 30:53
**Player 2:** for

### 30:54 - 30:56
**Player 2:** that. Okay. Or

### 30:56 - 30:58
**GM:** should we meet?

### 31:02 - 31:03
**Player 1:** Okay.

### 31:03 - 31:06
**GM:** So let's pencil in next

### 31:07 - 31:09
**GM:** Friday. And then we'll have

### 31:10 - 31:12
**GM:** a little bit

### 31:14 - 31:23
**GM:** of a hiatus. Maybe, I don't know if it's two weeks. By then, I think James will be,

### 31:26 - 31:27
**Player 1:** have

### 31:28 - 31:45
**GM:** made the trip, right? Yep. I actually fly out the 3rd. Okay. Okay. Assuming that the TSA and AGC Yeah. That's also assuming our flights aren't affected by the closures as well. Yeah.

### 31:48 - 31:56
**GM:** Oh, that's right. Yeah. So we'll hope for the best. And we'll suspend for now. Maybe

### 32:03 - 32:03
**Player 2:** if

### 32:04 - 32:06
**GM:** you want

### 32:07 - 32:07
**Player 2:** to

### 32:12 - 32:12
**GM:** run

### 32:13 - 32:18
**GM:** the transcripts through again, that would be helpful. Yep.

### 32:21 - 32:25
**GM:** I will try to use my new transcription

### 32:26 - 32:34
**GM:** agent. Okay, cool. Additional data points for testing. And we'll see everyone again on

### 32:35 - 32:35
**GM:** Friday.

### 32:37 - 33:02
**GM:** And then hopefully dim sum or buffet that Saturday. Sounds good. Okay. So have a good week. Hope for the shutdown to end. Indeed. All right. Yep. Have a good week, folks. Okay. All right. You too. Good week. All right. I was going to bring up the stars

### 33:04 - 33:07
**GM:** and wishes. Oh. With the

### 33:09 - 33:26
**GM:** other group. If you look on discord in the text channels under general. Okay. There's a link at the bottom that says stars and wishes. It's a little Facebook video of an idea.

### 33:28 - 33:37
**GM:** It's similar to like an agile retrospective where stars you can award to the other player. For things

### 33:40 - 33:41
**GM:** that you

### 33:42 - 33:43
**GM:** appreciate during

### 33:46 - 33:47
**Player 1:** the

### 33:49 - 33:50
**Player 1:** session. And then wishes are things that you would like to have seen or see in the future sessions. So we didn't do this with the last session of the other group. I think we watched it. We thought it might be interesting to try. We don't have to do it this time. But if you want to watch the video and think about that suggestion for at the end of next session, we can try it. If you think it might be fun to do. Sounds cool. Okay. And with that, we'll say good night. Good night, everyone. Good night, folks. Good night. Have a good night. Bye.

## Raw Transcript (for reference while editing)

Use this text to fill in the speaker sections above:

```
I guess Solira can make a wisdom check as you're being assaulted by the sights and sounds of the waterfront. You don't notice anything out of the ordinary as you come upon the Gilded Thorn. And so you see that it's a converted warehouse, but even though it was formerly a warehouse, you see that it's kind of has a gaudy opulent decor on the outside. You see parts of the wood frame kind of painted with a gold paint. And from within, you can hear song and clapping and various sounds of people enjoying themselves. Well, since this is an official business, I'll go ahead and open the door for myself. Okay. Oh, no, no, no, she's not. I'm about to open the door for myself and Zahra rushes forward. And open for you. As the door swings open, you notice both on the outside where Zahra opened the door, as well as immediately on the inside, you see some burly looking maybe bouncers or security kind of stationed on either side of the double doors that allow entrance into the Gilded Thorn. As you go up the steps and enter, the door opens into a wide open area with high rafters where the rafters are all painted gold with various chandeliers hanging, fueled by candles supported by a sequence of ropes and pulleys where the chandeliers can be lowered to be lit and then raised up high above to help illuminate. As the candlelight flickers off the golden beams, it cascades kind of a warm glow over the interior of the warehouse. On one end of the warehouse, you see a stage where there's some musicians playing. There's various tables scattered here and there. You see an area where folks are swaying and dancing to the music. And then there's another part of the warehouse which you can't see where long elaborate drapes kind of cascade from the ceiling down to the floor, kind of separating and partitioning off a whole section of the warehouse where you can't see. And near the front, as you step down the stairs onto the main floor, there's a greeter or proprietor who greets you. He's grinning. He's wearing an eyepatch. And he welcomes you to the Gilded Thorn. And he calls himself Bemro. Uncle Bemro. Did you say arg? No. He says, Uncle Bemro welcomes you to the Gilded Thorn. Please enter, enter and enjoy yourself. Whether you seek to enter new contracts, enjoy the drink and food, or entertainment, everyone here at the Gilded Thorn is here to serve you. And should you wish to have a private room, just come see me and ask. And he kind of opens he holds his left arm welcomingly, palm open as he ushers you further onto the floor of the Gilded Thorn. You see various tables both occupied and empty. There's many patrons here of various mercantile guilds dressed according to their stature. You see some that are very well decked out, others more practically so, though their clothing might be practical is by no means basic, right? It's good quality, exceptional dyed cloths with glinting fasteners, you know, whether they're silver buttons or other ornamentation. Some with fancy embroidery on velvet cloth, right? Many wearing elegant footwear. Not as to say that some aren't wearing more practical footwear like calf high boots. But even so, right, they seem to be well crafted and adorned. What does Sylera and Zodit do after they've surveyed the scene? Well, does Sylera recognize anybody? It takes a bit for you to absorb everything that's going on. And so while you're deciding what to do, we'll flip back to Parun and Orokod. So Parun is speaking with Mother Ghaul. So she asked him to speak plainly. And in response, Parun slightly bows, and a small smirk on his face, kind of recognizing what she's, you know, where she's coming from, it's like, tell me then, Mother Ghaul, what do you see of the murder crows near the water's edge? Their seals, they mark the trees, their whispers stir the mist. What are they watching? What do they serve? Or who do they serve? What in turn watches them? And he's got that piece of, what is it, bitter root or something, like, and he's holding it to her. And he sort of kind of adds very softly, I ask for my companion's sake. We would not walk blindly into their talons. And so she reaches out with your hand. And it seems like the root that you offered her just kind of fades from your grasp as she tucks her hand back within the folds of her dress, seemingly having captured your offering to her without much effort, but also without you noticing exactly how she ended up grasping hold of it. And she says that the murder crows serve themselves and perhaps a higher purpose, she says. They are currently in Brigerton in conflict with the order of the coin, as well as with the local commerce, as she smirks, in kind of a knowing fashion. And she says that though the murder crows are attempting to establish a more permanent foothold within Brigerton, they have desires and aims beyond. And she says there's whispers of a race to the sunken mint, of which I suspect you already know and may even be a part of. So not much information that we didn't already know. Let's see, sort of nods at her, thinking. And then she says, almost as if reading your mind, and says, but perhaps you are here as emissaries of the guard. Or perhaps the order of the coin themselves to deal with the murder crow incursion upon Brigerton. If that is your aim, ask away. Okay. Okay, so Prune's very intrigued. He straightens up. He's very intrigued that Mother Gull seems to sort of see through the surface questions, and he's a little concerned because her mentioning the guard and the order of the coin makes him think maybe they have been seen more closely than they realize. So he lowers his voice, sort of conspiratorially, but, you know, it's like, we are not emissaries nor coin-counting lackeys, but the crows, we have crossed paths. We mean to understand their presence here, to know what they seek, not just in Brigerton, but in the depths beneath. So tell me, Mother Gull, where do they roost? Who among them wears red feathers, and what folk here might feed them scraps? And she says, the crows are led by a triumvirate, whom you probably already know by name. And she says, kind of poking her chin towards the northeast, they roost in Shanty Row, and they frequent... Did you say Shanty Row? Yeah, which basically is the... That place of huts or whatever over there? Yeah, yeah. And she says, but seek no further than the rain barrel. Which rain barrel is that? Now who's speaking in riddles? The green pin just to the northeast of... Oh, the brothel. Which one? It's a brothel. It's called the rain barrel. Oh, I see, I see. Is that all she says? Yeah, she basically told you that that's a place where they roost, probably where they operate out of. You suspect that though it's a pleasure house, the murder crows have been able to either take control or subvert the house, or have something over the matron of the rain barrel in order to use that kind of as a base of operations. And Mother Gull tells you, yes, seek no further than the rain barrel for her matron is beneath their thumb. Okay. She says, I suspect that she would be ever so thankful should you free her of them. So, his response, he says, So, a triumvirate who would bind the flesh of this place under their feathered seal, and a brothel matron made their puppet. Indeed, indeed, she repeats. And he nods to himself. The rain barrel may spill more than ale and sweat. If she is truly beneath their thumb, perhaps she's the crack in their talons grip. And he smiles a bit. Mother Gull, you've stirred the pot well. If you hear more, if the orphans find things they should not, have them whisper it to the shadows. I will be listening. And he drops, so he pulls from a pouch, a scrap of a bent surgical pick, which is engraved with the symbol of Shun, a little small token into the stew pot, like a token of his thanks. And he turns away and steps back out into the steam and vanishes back to the alleys. Okay. Okay, so Perun was able to get some information from Mother Gull. Akkad, I think, was... He was watching the crate crawl. The crate crawl. Yeah, so it's obvious that either you have an invitation or you have knowledge of a password to be able to get past the entryway into the crate crawl. And it seems like the invitation takes the form of a coin. Any coin? You can't get a close enough look, but you see people flashing a coin. To be able to get in. And if they don't have a coin, you see them whispering something. So he's going to be looking, if anybody seems to be approaching it, like they want, anybody who's going to be entering the place, so he is going to, whichever one he identifies as being the most likely mark, he is going to do the classic thieves, street rogue, brush past, pickpocket, lift the coin from that person. Bump and roll. That's right. Bump and roll as if you were a drunk. Excuse me, sir. I didn't see you there. Or you yell at him. Watch it, you! Okay. So you spend some time observing and trying to identify an appropriate mark. You notice, though, that people don't just make a beeline to the entrance. You find them kind of appear out of nowhere. Primarily along the alleyway here. Buildings before they get to the entrance of the crate crawl. That's where a majority of people approach the entrance. They don't go down the road and make a beeline. So, unless you're taking position up in the alley, it's unlikely you'll be able to get close enough to someone that's obviously approaching the crate crawl. Yeah, he's going to move himself into the alley and sort of being, you know, in the shadows, maybe leaning up against a barrel, and, you know, kind of looking drunk, muttering to himself. And if a likely mark sort of comes past down the alley, he stumbles forward and bumps into them. Sorry. Okay. Which is actually not too bad because, aside from the warehouse underneath which the crate crawl provides access, the entryway, the surrounding buildings, there's a barrel right next to the warehouse, and then there's the ironworks across the street. So there's, even in the early evening, there's sounds of anvils and hammering, and basically sounds emanating from the workhouses that are in proximity. Though, as you make your way towards the alleyway between the barrel right and the warehouse, you see a burly figure kind of standing at the entrance of the alleyway, staring at you as you approach. Staring? He's in the entryway of the alley? Yeah, he's basically on the outer edge of the alleyway. He's within the alley, but on the edge, right? And so you have to pass him to get into the alleyway further, to get further into the alleyway. Okay. I mean, does it look like people are doing anything special to get past him, or is he just letting people go? So you observe that, from this angle, you observe that there's a special hand sign that's given. And if the hand sign's not given, he basically shoos people away from the alley. So in his observations, has Akai been able to learn this hand sign? Can he deliver it? He thinks he can. He's observed it a few times, kind of from, perhaps off by the crates, kind of peering between the crates to witness the approach. Some people who come down towards the alleyway are shooed off and they continue down the side of the warehouse. And for folks that disappear into the alleyway, they seem to make a hand signal, which Prune is able to witness a few times. And so it's a hand gesture that's made with both hands. So he's going to be posing as somewhat tipsy so that he might not completely, you know, be able to pull this off, you know, because he's a bit drunk, you know, but he's going to his typical haunt and he's like, oh, yeah. And he approaches it and comes up to this person as he's walking down the alley and just like, and then delivers the sign the best he can. Okay. So make a dexterity check. Like trip a little bit as he's doing it. Oh, yeah. Okay. You managed to pull off the double hand gesture. You know, you combine your fingers and, you know, twist your hands around, you know, kind of reminiscent of, here's a church, here's a steeple. Here are all the people, you know, kind of gesture. And you are given access to the alleyway. All right. So he's going to continue moving down the alleyway and find an appropriate spot where he can, you know, set himself up to do the bump and roll and lift a coin. Okay. So do you want to be closer to the entryway or closer to, the entryway to the alleyway or? No, I think he's going to want to be like, there's like a little niche here, maybe like in this kind of area. So someplace, I mean, he's going to want to stay somewhat hidden, but in a location where he could sort of stumble and it's like, oh. Okay. So right about kind of midway in the alleyway, there's various crates and iron rings and whatnot used in barrel making that are kind of stacked along the wall of the workhouse. And so you're able to kind of find a, kind of a partially obscured location behind some of the boards that have yet to be prepared to be fitted into a barrel. And you lay in wait for an inappropriate target. So we can switch back to Salir and Zadet as they survey their surroundings within the Gilded Thorn. So basically I want to find a group to approach and strike up a conversation with, but if I see someone that I recognize, then that would be an easy entry. Okay. So I would also call out that it's almost 930. Yes, it is. So we can pause here and then resume sometime because I think two weeks from now, Debs and I will be on our way to Connecticut. And I will be in North Carolina and Tennessee that week. Oh, okay. Do we want to try to meet in a week? I think I could do that. I'm good for that. Okay. Or should we meet? Okay. So let's pencil in next Friday. And then we'll have a little bit of a hiatus. Maybe, I don't know if it's two weeks. By then, I think James will be, have made the trip, right? Yep. I actually fly out the 3rd. Okay. Okay. Assuming that the TSA and AGC Yeah. That's also assuming our flights aren't affected by the closures as well. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah. So we'll hope for the best. And we'll suspend for now. Maybe if you want to run the transcripts through again, that would be helpful. Yep. I will try to use my new transcription agent. Okay, cool. Additional data points for testing. And we'll see everyone again on Friday. And then hopefully dim sum or buffet that Saturday. Sounds good. Okay. So have a good week. Hope for the shutdown to end. Indeed. All right. Yep. Have a good week, folks. Okay. All right. You too. Good week. All right. I was going to bring up the stars and wishes. Oh. With the other group. If you look on discord in the text channels under general. Okay. There's a link at the bottom that says stars and wishes. It's a little Facebook video of an idea. It's similar to like an agile retrospective where stars you can award to the other player. For things that you appreciate during the session. And then wishes are things that you would like to have seen or see in the future sessions. So we didn't do this with the last session of the other group. I think we watched it. We thought it might be interesting to try. We don't have to do it this time. But if you want to watch the video and think about that suggestion for at the end of next session, we can try it. If you think it might be fun to do. Sounds cool. Okay. And with that, we'll say good night. Good night, everyone. Good night, folks. Good night. Have a good night. Bye.
