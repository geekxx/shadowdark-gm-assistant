GM: Welcome to the Rusty Dragon tavern!
Player (Kira): I order a pint of ale and ask the barkeep about local rumors.
GM: The grizzled barkeep leans in and whispers, "Strange lights have been seen at the old wizard's tower north of town. Some say it's haunted, others think treasure hunters are at work."
Player (Thane): I ask if anyone has investigated recently.
GM: "Aye, young Marcus went up there three days ago. Haven't seen him since. His sister is worried sick."
Player (Kira): We should check it out. Any other details about the tower?
GM: "Built by old Malachar the Grey, died in there some say. Tower's been empty for twenty years. But those lights... they only started last week."
