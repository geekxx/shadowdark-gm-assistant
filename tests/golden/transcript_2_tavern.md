**Campaign:** Western Reaches  
**Session:** 5

---

**GM:** You enter The Prancing Pony tavern. It's busy tonight - merchants, locals, and a few rough-looking travelers fill the common room.

**Kira (Elf Wizard):** I want to look for our contact, the merchant Aldric. Do I see anyone matching his description?

**GM:** Roll a WIS check to scan the crowd.

**Kira:** *rolls* 12

**GM:** You spot a well-dressed man in the corner booth, nervously fiddling with a silver ring. That matches Aldric's description.

**Thane (Human Fighter):** I'll approach him directly. No point being subtle.

**Aldric (NPC):** *looks up nervously* You're the ones asking about the missing caravan? Keep your voices down. There are ears everywhere.

**Kira:** What can you tell us about what happened?

**Aldric:** The caravan never reached Millbrook. Last seen three days ago, heading through Thornwood Pass. Local guards won't investigate - they're afraid.

**Thane:** Afraid of what?

**Aldric:** Strange lights in the forest. Unnatural sounds at night. Some say the old druid's curse has awakened.

**GM:** As Aldric speaks, you notice a hooded figure at the bar has turned to listen. They're trying to be subtle but failing.

**Kira:** I want to cast a minor illusion to distract them while we finish talking.

**GM:** Roll INT + proficiency for your spell.

**Kira:** *rolls* 16!

**GM:** You create the sound of breaking glass from the kitchen. The eavesdropper turns away, distracted.

**Aldric:** *slides you a rough map* This shows the caravan route. If you find them... or what's left... there's 100 gold in it for you.

**Thane:** We'll look into it. Any other warnings?

**Aldric:** Don't travel the pass at night. And if you see blue flames dancing between the trees, turn back immediately.

**GM:** Aldric finishes his drink and hurries out through the back door. The hooded figure follows shortly after.

**Kira:** Should we follow the spy?

**GM:** That's where we'll pick up next time. Both of you get 1 XP for good roleplay and investigation work.

**Players:** Exciting! Can't wait to explore Thornwood Pass.
