**GM:** Welcome back! Last time you discovered the entrance to the old watchtower. The heavy oak door stands before you, its iron hinges rusted with age.

**Kira (Elf Wizard):** I want to check for magical traps before we enter. Can I detect magic?

**GM:** Roll an INT check to sense magical auras.

**Kira:** *rolls* 15!

**GM:** You sense faint necromantic energy emanating from beyond the door. Something undead lies within.

**Thane (Human Fighter):** Undead? Good thing I brought my silver-blessed sword. I'll push the door open slowly.

**GM:** The door creaks loudly as it swings inward. The sound echoes up a spiral staircase that disappears into darkness. Roll initiative - three skeletons descend the stairs, weapons drawn!

**Kira:** *rolls* 4

**Thane:** *rolls* 6

**GM:** *rolls for skeletons* 2. You both go first. Thane?

**Thane:** I charge the lead skeleton with my sword. *rolls* 18 to hit!

**GM:** That's a hit! Roll damage.

**Thane:** *rolls* 6 damage!

**GM:** Your silver blade cleaves through the skeleton's ribcage. It collapses in a pile of bones. Kira?

**Kira:** I'll cast Magic Missile at the closest remaining skeleton. *rolls* 3 damage!

**GM:** The glowing dart strikes its skull. Now the remaining skeletons attack...

*Combat continues for several rounds*

**GM:** After the battle, you search the tower's ground floor. You find 25 gold pieces hidden in a wall crevice and an old map showing local cave systems.

**Kira:** The map - does it show anything interesting?

**GM:** It marks several caves to the north, with one marked with a skull symbol and the word "Beware" in ancient script.

**Thane:** That sounds promising. Or terrifying. Maybe both.

**GM:** As you examine the map, you hear sounds from upstairs - something larger moving around.

**Kira:** Should we investigate or come back later?

**GM:** That's a good place to pause. You both gain 1 XP for defeating the skeletons, and Kira gets an extra XP for smart use of magic detection.

**Players:** Great session!
