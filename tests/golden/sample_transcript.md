# Sample Session Transcript

**GM:** Welcome back to our Shadowdark campaign! Last session, you were heading toward the Whispering Woods after hearing rumors of an ancient shrine.

**Kira (Elf Wizard):** I want to cast Light on my staff before we enter the forest.

**GM:** Good idea. Your staff glows with bright light, illuminating the Near area around you. The forest is dense, with gnarled trees creating twisted shadows.

**Thane (Human Fighter):** I'll take point with my sword ready. Do I see any obvious paths?

**GM:** Roll a WIS check to navigate the forest.

**Thane:** *rolls* 14!

**GM:** You spot what looks like an old deer trail winding deeper into the woods. As you follow it, you notice strange symbols carved into some of the trees.

**Kira:** The symbols - do I recognize them? I'll use my arcane knowledge.

**GM:** Roll an INT check.

**Kira:** *rolls* 16!

**GM:** These are druidic ward markers, likely placed to protect something sacred. They seem very old but still active.

**Thane:** Should we be worried?

**GM:** As you debate, you hear rustling in the underbrush. Three dire wolves emerge, their eyes glowing with unnatural hunger.

**Kira:** Initiative!

**GM:** *rolls for wolves* They got a 4. Roll for your side.

**Thane:** *rolls* 5! We go first.

**GM:** Thane, you're up first.

**Thane:** I charge the lead wolf with my longsword. *rolls* 17 to hit!

**GM:** That hits! Roll damage.

**Thane:** *rolls* 7 damage!

**GM:** Your blade bites deep into the wolf's flank. It snarls but stays standing. Kira?

**Kira:** I'll cast Magic Missile at the wounded one. *rolls* 4 damage!

**GM:** The glowing dart strikes true, and the wolf collapses. The other two wolves attack...

*Combat continues*

**GM:** After the battle, you find the path leads to a moss-covered stone shrine. Ancient runes cover its surface, and a crystal sits in a depression at the top.

**Kira:** I want to examine the crystal carefully.

**GM:** It pulses with faint magical energy. This looks like it could be a focus for druidic magic.

**Thane:** Is it valuable?

**GM:** Hard to say without touching it. Could be worth 50-100 gold to the right buyer.

**Kira:** I'll carefully take it, wrapping it in cloth.

**GM:** As you lift the crystal, the forest around you seems to sigh, and you feel a sense of ancient approval.

**GM:** That's a good place to end tonight. Kira, take 1 XP for clever use of magic identification. Thane, 1 XP for brave leadership in combat. You both found the Moonwell Crystal - that's another 1 XP each for exploration.

**Players:** Great session!
