WEBVTT

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
GM: I think, are we ready to play?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, I think so.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I think so.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yep.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
GM: Alright.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
GM: So, yeah, this will be a gauntlet, um…

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
GM: And…

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
GM: You find yourself in this cursed place that serves as.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
GM: Sort of a crucible, uh, for an ooze-worshipping cult.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
GM: Um, those who survive this crucible are granted a boon from the slime lord, and those who do not.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
GM: Get to wander the halls as the unquiet dead, doomed to serve the ooze for eternity.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
GM: So you have all been kidnapped from your village and thrown into a pit to face the trial of the Slime Lord.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
GM: Um, you have all…

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
GM: Landed at the bottom here, and a heavy stone lid is sliding across the opening that you were thrown through.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:59.000
GM: And with nothing more than your wits, the clothes on your back, and any equipment you might have refined, you must escape or die.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
GM: Uh, within this room, there is a lit torch lying on the floor.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000
GM: I think we're starting out. It's Born, uh… Born, your turn to move your characters, you're in the pit, there's a torch.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
GM: Um, what's born doing?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Born/Calgalcandar: This is a torch lit.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
GM: Yes.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… Born will pick up that torch.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000
GM: Alright, you should be able to drag it onto your inventory, I think, or right onto your token, that should put it in your inventory.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Born/Calgalcandar: You cannot take this action while a game is paused.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
GM: There we go.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
GM: That worked. That worked.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, let me see…

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
GM: Or did it work?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
GM: Did not work.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Born/Calgalcandar: No, I do not show a torch… lit torch in my inventory.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
GM: Alright, then we will do this…

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
GM: Make you do that, I will just…

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
GM: Give you a new torch.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
GM: There you go.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright, and…

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Born/Calgalcandar: There it is. Okay.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… then…

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
GM: So, some… some information more about this room, um…

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
GM: You do notice that there's, uh, the walls are glistening slime-slick.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
GM: Um, and you hear the sound of running water echoing faintly.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
GM: Through, uh, that archway that goes to the south, where you're moving to.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
GM: Uh, and you see some words as you step up there carved onto the archway.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
GM: Uh, they read, Welcome to Dissolution, Escape or Feed Raka Uku.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
GM: And…

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
GM: Uh, you should be able to see it in the chat.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
GM: Several times, actually.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
GM: That's what you see carved up above the archway.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I think that's my turn. I picked up the torque.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
GM: Okay, and then move your second PC as well.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Born/Calgalcandar: And…

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Born/Calgalcandar: The which one?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
GM: Your second PC that's there?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
GM: You're all moving together through here.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
GM: A whole crowd.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
GM: And then Scrabble.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, Scrabble is gonna head…

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: or…

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I can get him to move.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
GM: Oh, uh, born, you left your compatriots in the dark.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Scrabble's gonna head for this door.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
GM: Okay…

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And uh… I'm gonna try the door real quick, is it…

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I just want to open it if it's unlocked.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
GM: Um, you notice that the door is slightly ajar, actually.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, great.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, Jim, yeah, I will…

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Just open the door.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And step in.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
GM: Alright, you don't see much because the torchlight doesn't, uh…

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
GM: filter in there.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, right? Yeah, yeah.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, alright, I'll pause there.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: We'll have to, uh, sort out the, uh…

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: The voice situation, and uh…

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: was more at the one.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Alright, let's it for me.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
GM: Alright, Garm.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Garm/Loren: Okay…

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Garm/Loren: Six…

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Garm/Loren: We'll go to here, and…

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Garm/Loren: And here, I'll double move.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
GM: Alright.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
GM: And then move your other character as well.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Garm/Loren: I don't see another character.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
GM: Oh, because they're probably in the darkness, right?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
GM: Philomena.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, I guess I'll double move as well.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, towards here?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh, also, same for, uh.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: see Radzik, but I don't see…

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I don't see the token.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, thanks.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, around here.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
GM: I'm going to…

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
GM: Uh, Valaxis.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: 20… 30…

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, Laxis was going to do a double move.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh…

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
GM: Okay.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Just trying to step into this room just to see if you can see anything.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And what does he… what is the little bit he sees there? I guess it's just a piece of wall.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
GM: Um… You do… you notice, you know, the light shining a little bit on maybe… could be, like, a pile of…

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
GM: garbage or detritus, um, sort of heaped against that wall. From what you can see, it's probably…

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
GM: There's more of that in there, but it's very little light so far, so you don't see a whole lot.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Ulara/Valaxis: We'll step back out then.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And…

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
GM: Alright, and what happened to…

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
GM: What happened to it?

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
GM: Ah, okay, I see, I can't do that.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
GM: And… back to Born.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hmm.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
GM: So as you step forward, uh, your torch casts light into this room, and…

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
GM: You know, it's, um…

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
GM: detritus and stuff just haphazardly heaped against the walls and corners. Other than that, it's a very plain room.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
GM: Um, you do spy in some of the…

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
GM: Heaps of garbage and stuff, there might be some… some items in there.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yeah.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
GM: You also notice that there are several footprint or humanoid-sized footprints on the floor.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um… hmm.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Stay there, let us quickly search, we might find another torch, or weapons, or something.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, yeah, I can't select…

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yep, that's… seems like the right idea.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I can't select my, uh, second character.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
GM: Um… which one's your second one?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… Kellong, uh, Calondry? Uh, whatever.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
GM: You can't select him, huh? Um…

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I think Philomena is on… the token is on top.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
GM: How's that?

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: There, yeah.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
GM: Okay.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Laundria, I will go in and…

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, uh, let's do this.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, good lord. Okay.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
GM: You have to move forward one and then left to get around the corner of the door.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Actually, if you move over… over to the right one.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: It's really… okay, there we go! Hey!

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Right. Yeah.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um… uh…

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Born/Calgalcandar: this character.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Calgalcander for short. We'll search this room.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:14.000
GM: Okay, um, so roll on the random gear table. I think I dropped that in the chat, you should be able to click the button and roll.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: You do not have sufficient permission.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Born/Calgalcandar: To view the sheet for this role table.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
GM: Alright, let me see if I can fix that.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
GM: Um…

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Should I just roll a D20?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
GM: No, I think this'll work. Uh, let me…

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
GM: I think…

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
GM: Nah, get in there.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
GM: Uh, try it now.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh! Okay…

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
GM: Something happened?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… I see table configuration random gear.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
GM: You didn't see a random gear button in the chat?

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, okay, here we go.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
GM: There you go.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
GM: So… Gal can…

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
GM: Calgalcander got a rope.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
GM: And I should be able to add that to your inventory.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
GM: Yep, there you go.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
GM: Right, who's up next?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
GM: You gonna move your other character?

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Let's see, I moved both, uh, born and cow, so…

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
GM: Okay, so it's Scrabble's turn?

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, I think Born is on top of Scrabble, I can't get to the token.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Let me see if I can…

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, there we go, thank you. Yeah, uh…

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, Born is… or, uh, Scrabble, rather, is also gonna search this room.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
GM: Alright, go ahead and, uh…

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
GM: Roll on the random gear table.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
GM: So in the chat, you should be able to just click that button again.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Let's see…

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I think it's a whole table definition.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Popping opens.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
GM: You see, there should be a little button by it.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
GM: That's in the ch- in the, in, um, the chat.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
GM: It says random gear.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
GM: And if you click on that…

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, when I click on it, uh…

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, I see, way at the bottom of this dialog, okay.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: There we go.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
GM: There you go. Uh, you got a poll. Do you want the poll?

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, I'll take the poll.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
GM: You have a hole.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And uh… Was Moet will do the same thing.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
GM: All right, Mosmet can take a roll on the table?

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
GM: Uh, an empty flask.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
GM: And Garm.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: unexciting, but I'll take it, yeah.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
GM: James, you're gonna, uh, Garm's turn.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
GM: You're on mute.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Garm/Loren: Okay. Um, who's got the lit torch right now?

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
GM: Born does.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Garm/Loren: Born? Okay.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Born/Calgalcandar: form.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Garm/Loren: Distance mature.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, I'll go here, um, and I've got a torch in my inventory that I'll pull out.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Garm/Loren: And… get ready to light. I don't have a way to light it.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Garm/Loren: You know, ask Warren to light it on his…

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, yeah, you could light it off, uh, Born's torch.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
GM: Alright.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, Scrabble also has, uh, lint and steel.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
GM: I think you have a few flinted wheels amongst you all.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Garm/Loren: Put a slated off of the parchment.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, I don't think Loren has light to do anything, so…

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Garm/Loren: She will…

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
GM: So Loren and Garm could both do a search of that room.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Garm/Loren: Standard.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Garm/Loren: Which room?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
GM: See if there's any… this, uh, over here, um…

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
GM: People have been searching all of the garbage and trash in there, and…

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
GM: Finding some useful things.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Garm/Loren: Oh, is there… is it lit? It looks unlit to me.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
GM: Uh, it is unlit, I guess. Somebody, uh, Born moved out of the way.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
GM: Well, I moved one out of the way, so there.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
GM: Was born there, you can see it.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, yeah. Loren will definitely go in. I think.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
GM: Alright.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Garm/Loren: Garm will spend his turn, his action lighting, but Loren will spend her action searching.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
GM: Alright, so if you light off of…

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
GM: Born's Torch, it's a free action.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Garm/Loren: Oh, okay, yeah, then Grab will go in, too.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Garm/Loren: Oops, sorry, not going…

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
GM: Let me move you, because it's kind of a cluster there, and it's hard, there you go, so…

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000
GM: In the chat window, um, you should see there's the…

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Garm/Loren: Parallel park them in there.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
GM: There's a, uh, random gear.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
GM: Button. There you go.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Garm/Loren: Ooh, infinite torches!

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
GM: So…

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Garm/Loren: Spend a torch, get a torch.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
GM: Who gets the four silver pieces?

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Garm/Loren: Loren, with a greedy elf.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Garm/Loren: That face doesn't… you know, that face requires a lot of maintenance.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
GM: And that extra torch, who's that going to?

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Garm/Loren: Let's go buy some…

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, that will also go to Loren. Uh, Garm already has a second torch in his inventory.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
GM: There you go. And I think that brings us to Philomena.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Gear! I want gear as well.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So, I'm gonna get… I see, like, there is a line there.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, yeah.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh…

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I'll, uh… can I roll on the… on the same table, I guess?

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
GM: Yep. You betcha.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
GM: So that is…

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh…

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.000
GM: When it's a chair leg, a spent torch or something similar can be used as a club.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
GM: Do you want Philomena to have the club?

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yes.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh, Serdi gives…

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000
GM: Well, Philomena's already… Philomena already has a short bow of arrows.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, also seriously got a short bow and arrow, also, like, and a dagger.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, like, I didn't even look up on what they had as gear, but…

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Pretty good. And, uh…

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, can you move Sergei for me over there? Because, like, I cannot see the token.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
GM: Yeah. Hmm…

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, I'm gonna roll for…

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
GM: And Sergei gets a roll.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yes.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Another talker. Oh, wow.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I've got characters that'll take a dagger if you… yours don't want it.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
GM: And…

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
GM: Yeah, you do all have… most of you got some starting gear, so…

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
GM: There's at least your light sources, you have.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
GM: 4 torches, total.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I mean, if anybody has surplus weapons, is there anybody who doesn't have a weapon?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, one of mine has… the Laxis is using a grappling hook.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Hmm.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And Ullara has, uh…

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Either a pole, or try to wield an iron spike and shove it through somebody.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: No, I can give you a dagger, like, the dagger that I just got…

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I can give it to you.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
GM: I actually have… oh, you have 5 torches.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Ulara/Valaxis: The Dagger to Ulara would be nice.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah, I don't… I could maybe do an improvised weapon with a crowbar, or a, uh…

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Garm/Loren: Or a grappling hook, but none of my characters have actual.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Garm/Loren: Honest to goodness weapons?

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, one of my torches should be lit.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So…

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Garm/Loren: Correct? I'm not seeing it as being lit.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
GM: You have to go in your inventory and click it.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Garm/Loren: Alright. Cool.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
GM: And I think it's Valexis' turn now?

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah, so both my characters will go in.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Ulara/Valaxis: to…

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
GM: Do the thing. Alright, I'll move you just to…

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Well, and then they'll be able to move in and get back out again at the end, so…

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So they'll come out.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
GM: Alright. Make two rolls on the table.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So…

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mmm… not there.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
GM: Who gets that?

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, so that can go to…

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Actually, somebody else was saying they needed a…

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, weapon, so…

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, well, actually, Valaxis doesn't have any weapons, so…

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Ulara/Valaxis: The dagger will go to the Laxis.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
GM: And the gold goes to…

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Ulara.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Garm/Loren: Gold?

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Garm/Loren: Damn.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Ulara/Valaxis: What gold? What gold? I didn't hear anything about gold.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
GM: Ow.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Garm/Loren: Oh, you know what I just noticed, um…

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Garm/Loren: Jeff, is that my dwarf… I didn't change the languages.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Garm/Loren: So my dwarf knows orcish and not dwarvish.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
GM: Ah, okay.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Born/Calgalcandar: He's forsaken his heritage.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Garm/Loren: Or maybe I can edit it myself.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
GM: You should be able to.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Or he was orphaned and raised by, uh…

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well, work.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I'm raised by half-orcs.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Garm/Loren: Alright, yeah, cool. Right, yeah, I didn't realize we could edit it then.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
GM: Alright, so I think that ends round 2.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
GM: And…

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
GM: Back to Born.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Let's see… go down here…

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Ho ho! Look at that.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
GM: Uh, so…

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000
GM: You light filters down into a cavern, uh, the stairs leading down.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
GM: You, um…

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
GM: You hear the… you smell a faint…

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
GM: Smell of, kind of, rot coming from that direction.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Born/Calgalcandar: The stairs going down.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000
GM: Yeah, kind of from here, there's a… it's a kind of an unpleasant odor coming from that direction.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Well then…

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I'll go this direction.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So let's… it's gonna be… 5…

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
GM: And… yep.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 10, 15…

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 20… 25… 30…

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh-ho.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:46.000
GM: So, as you step in, before you, you see three lumpy and misshapen statues.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
GM: They're casting ominous shadows in your flickering torchlight.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000
GM: Um, each one of them depicts what looks like a humanoid figure is undergoing.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:03.000
GM: uh, some kind of a slime-related trauma. Um, you can hear the sound of running water, um.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
GM: coming from the Northeast.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, uh… basically, I had to do a double move to get to that point, so…

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
GM: Okay. And so then you're…

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Born/Calgalcandar: That's the…

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
GM: Your next… your next PC, then?

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, I can't see them.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
GM: Oh, um…

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
GM: Which one's… that's its name?

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Born/Calgalcandar: uh, cow.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
GM: Oh yeah, you want to bring him along with you?

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, sure.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
GM: Alright, he's with ya.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
GM: And then we go to Scrabble.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh… alright, I have no idea where Born has run off to.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So, this is…

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: A little daunting.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Now I see the blow from this torch.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
GM: Yeah, you're pinging, not dragging. There you go.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I know, it's weird.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Why? What am I doing?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: There we go.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Sweet.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: If I click and hold for…

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: 50 milliseconds, I can move. If I click and hold for 55 milliseconds, it just pings.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Really annoying. Uh, so I'm gonna double move to…

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Catch up with, well…

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And I think, uh, Wazamoet will do the same thing, although I can no longer see his token.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
GM: Um, which one is that? What's the…

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
GM: Aim.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Wasmoët?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Could be over here somewhere, I think.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, there we go.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That's good for me.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Is there a way we can select the two tokens at the same time and move them together?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
GM: Garm?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
GM: Uh, you should be able to shift-click them.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
GM: and get to.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
GM: And it's, uh, Garm's turn.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Garm/Loren: Yes, yeah. Um…

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
GM: James?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Garm/Loren: I can't select him, because he's under a token there.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Garm/Loren: I think…

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Garm/Loren: There we go.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, they will come out, and…

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Garm/Loren: Here…

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
GM: Alright, uh, Philomena?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, yeah, like, I'm leaving the room.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mm-hmm. Did you say that one of yours had…

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh…

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Ulara/Valaxis: An extra dagger.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the… the goblin, I think.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Do we, like, uh, where is your character?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh… the one just inside the room, the door to the room.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay, sorry, like, I'm gonna…

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Just… Oh, I see, okay, like, uh, okay.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yup, aye.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Well, like, uh…

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, Certzig is gonna give you, uh…

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: a darker, then.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: That would be appreciated.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yep.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Should I, like, uh…

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I cannot see anything here, so I cannot… I don't know how to pass, like, uh, which…

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Actually, if you just drop it off of yours, I could…

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay, okay, okay.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I believe added into wine.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
GM: Yeah, I mean, you should… if you open your inventory, you should be able to drag it onto their token.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah…

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
GM: And that should… trade it.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
GM: Or pass it over.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, let me see, like, if, uh…

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: perfect, like, I think it's…

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: It should be somewhere there, I cannot see anything, like, because there is no light, but…

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Should it be that.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So I move out…

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh…

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay. There's a line still. Okay, okay.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
GM: Damn, we got a… got a big line trying to get into the room.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: It's like being in a supermarket.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, okay, I guess I'm gonna…

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: with my… my line, I suppose, and…

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
GM: Oh. I see that dagger is still laying there, so should that go to…

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
GM: uh… Loren?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Ulara/Valaxis: To Loren.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Mhm.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh, yeah, if you can move, sir, Zig for me, because I couldn't select, because there was no light anymore.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So…

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
GM: Alright, Lara has the dagger…

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay. Actually, I have a question, like, we see some light here, like, at the bottom, like, of the.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: South Corridor.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Or, uh, is it, uh…

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Is it a glitch?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
GM: Oh, uh, interesting.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Run to the light.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
GM: Yeah, if you see it, you see it. You're not supposed to see it, but…

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, I gotta… I'm not gonna metagame, of course, but…

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
GM: That's kinda weird.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
GM: I'm surprised that that…

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
GM: Uh, well… yeah, I guess they…

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
GM: Technically, I suppose you would see a glow from that direction.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, yeah, like, if it's not, uh, if there is no…

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Nothing obstructing it, I suppose we do see it, so…

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I don't know, like, uh, can… like, what do we see there?

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Making the salad.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
GM: Um… from where you're at…

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
GM: Let's see, yeah, you do see at the very end what looks to be a pair of massive double doors.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Mhm.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
GM: And there's some faint light flickering around them, illuminating that area.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
GM: And then the Laxis, you're moving up there, and…

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah, what's, uh, in this…

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Ulara/Valaxis: There's another room here, I guess, that, uh…

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
GM: Which direction?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Well, okay, so… to the…

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: East, it stares down into a large cavern, and.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And then…

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.000
GM: Yeah, stairs go down into some sort of a cavern, there's a foul smell coming from that direction, and then everybody else is lined up.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
GM: To get into a room over here.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Thank you.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
GM: And… born.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Garm/Loren: I'll let you cut in front of me for 20 gold coins.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I'm going in the room. Boom! Look at that.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
GM: In the room, okay.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah. Uh, could you bring along my second character, who's…

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Born/Calgalcandar: There we go.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Still stuck in the last journal?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
GM: Oh, yeah.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, I…

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: No, not there. Boom!

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
GM: Yeah, there's a passage there to the northeast.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, that's weird, I only see… oh, okay.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I understand what's going on now.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um…

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Can't… can I moot?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, yeah, there we go.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
GM: Yeah, so down at the end of there, you see…

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
GM: Um… the corridor ends in some stairs that go down, and you can see some, um…

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
GM: What you hear, and see what looks to be some water.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um, let's see, so that would have been…

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 5…

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30…

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 35…

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, I think I had to do a double move to get there.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um, so now, uh, I can't actually see my second character.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um, okay, Calgalcander's gonna go down… oop.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hello!

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I can't… okay, there we go.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: And examine that.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Born/Calgalcandar: thing there.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
GM: Alright, so that statue, um…

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
GM: It appears they all appear to be made of some sort of a, like, a chalky, pale green substance.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hmm…

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
GM: Uh, and…

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
GM: Uh, the one there, uh, that you stand before is a waist-high pile of ooze.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000
GM: Um, with 3 depressions suggesting sort of like a face with empty eyes and a gaping mouth.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
GM: And a plaque on the plinth reads.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
GM: The final offering is all.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hmm.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Garm/Loren: Is that… is that here?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
GM: Um, that's… that's this statue that he was looking at.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, Calgalcander will use a crowbar and poke the statue.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
GM: Um, it, uh, a little bit of that chalky substance flakes off, um.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
GM: And as you're doing that, you also notice on the floor, um.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
GM: Uh, the base of the statue is a, uh, a piece of paper.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, I will pick that up.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
GM: Alright, it looks to be a page of a journal, and as you read it…

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
GM: Uh, it's in the chat.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.000
GM: And with that, I think it probably goes to Scrabble now. Everybody can see the writing in the chat.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
GM: The journal? Okay.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
GM: So, Scrabble gonna look at that statue?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, and uh…

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, WASMOET will look at the northernmost statue, so we're gonna…

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.000
GM: Okay, so the middle statue, um, it looks like the upper half of a skeleton rising from an unidentifiable puddle.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:33.000
GM: Its arms are also raised up, and its jaws hang open. A plaque on the plinth reads, The second offering is bone.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
GM: And that, uh, northern statue is a man half-covered in slime.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:49.000
GM: Um, that's dissolving the flesh from his bones. His arms are raised up in exaltation, and there's a joyous expression on what remains of his face, because it's kind of rotting, or melting away.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
GM: And the plaque on this one reads, the first offering is flesh.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Hmm.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Alright. Not great, but okay.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
GM: Cram?

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
GM: James, is Grandma moving into the room?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
GM: Um, I can show you a picture of the statues, actually.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
GM: There you go.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, flesh, bone, and all. Okay.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That's terrifying.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, currently, Calgalcander stands in front of all, correct?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
GM: Uh… yeah, so the picture is reversed of what they actually are, so…

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
GM: Flesh is this one.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
GM: Bone is this one, and then all is this one.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So the progression is north to south.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: for the stitches.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
GM: And go ahead and move your other, uh, character, James, and Philomena.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
GM: So in terms of actions, um, remember, uh, we… so it's… both characters move, but only one gets an action.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
GM: That will help us speed things up a bit.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
GM: Basically, the other PC is tagging along as, you know, uh…

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
GM: Replacement. Meat.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: For sacrifice for these altars.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Haha, exactly.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: That's why we are having that discussion.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Can I see the…

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Image again.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Thank you, sir.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: All is south, you said.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
GM: Yeah.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And where does the water noise… where do I hear?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
GM: From up here, where Born is, in the northeast, there's a passage there that he's standing in.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay… yeah, I guess that I will move when I get theft.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
GM: Okay.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh, Sirzyk does the same.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
GM: Anvilaxis…

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Just do that.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh…

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sorry.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oops.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Alexis will have a long…

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And, um…

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Ulara/Valaxis: If you could bring my second character, thank you.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, looks like everything's being examined…

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um… yeah, we'll surf.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Double move to get up to there, so that's it.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I think having a lower initiative here is a good thing, I feel.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
GM: Uh, born.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay…

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Cuz born is not the brightest bulb in the room.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Calgalcander! Calgalcander Sal.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Born!

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Take a sliver of flesh and put it on that statue.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, Born will do that.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
GM: Alright, so…

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Born/Calgalcandar: This one's right there.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
GM: He's gonna take his dagger and, what, cut some…

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
GM: Cut some flesh off.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
GM: Alright, well, that's gonna…

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
GM: Cause a hit point. Um…

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
GM: And… and Born is doing this?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yup.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
GM: Alright.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
GM: And, um, so you…

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
GM: Cuts a piece of skin off, um, lays it on the statue, and there's now a…

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
GM: Bloody piece of meat on the statue, but nothing else happens.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hmm.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Warren will proceed.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
GM: Yeah, you can get about right there. And as you enter this room, you see…

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
GM: Um…

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000
GM: clear, knee-deep water circling, um, around in this room. There appears to be a rusty gate in the middle that the water is draining into.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
GM: Um, you see roots dangling from cracks, uh, in the sagging stone ceiling.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
GM: Uh, and then you see another passage to the, uh, southwest.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Let's see… uh… Calgalcander is going to…

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Basically, move up the sideboard.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
GM: Okay, and… Scrabble.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, so…

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Why is my wet roll.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah. Uh, can he get all the way to the drain?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
GM: Uh, from here…

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well, actually, he was… he was here.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
GM: Oh, so from there to the drain?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
GM: You could get to right where Born is.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That's annoying. Um…

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, I'll double move and go past Born.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, overtop by the drain.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
GM: Okay.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
GM: I have an idea, let's go ahead and do this. This should make…

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
GM: share.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, you said this room is full of, like.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Knee-deep water.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
GM: Yeah, and as you step into the water, it's, uh, it feels very cool.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
GM: Uh, it's clear, um, and like I said, below your, your feet, um.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
GM: Let me there. You see this drain right here, and the water appears to be flowing down into it.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yep.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
GM: And if you look at the grate, you see some small bones resting on it.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um…

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Right.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, I'll… grab the bones.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
GM: Alright.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
GM: You have some small… look like some bones for maybe a small animal or something?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, and…

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
GM: And then underneath it is this grate.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Scrutinizing it, does it seem like there's anything on the other side of the grate?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
GM: Yeah, looking at it, you see what seems to be…

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:41.000
GM: Um, could be maybe a brass key just on the other side, sort of wedged into a rock, into this, um.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
GM: poll.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And how… how wide is the drain? What's its diameter?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
GM: Um…

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
GM: It's pretty small, um, you figure, you know, a halfling or a goblin might fit down it.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, Scrabble shouts back to the rest of the crowd, send up a crowbar and the goblin.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, and that'll be it for…

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
GM: Okay.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
GM: And so…

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
GM: Garm.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
GM: What is your other PC doing?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
GM: Uh, for Scrabble's Compatriot?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, uh, he's just hanging out. That, I think, is the Bethel movement of his movement.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
GM: Following?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
GM: Okay.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
GM: Okay. Uh, so it's Garm's turn.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
GM: James.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
GM: And both of them, you're gonna have them moved in there?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
GM: Do you check out the drain, uh, any… at all? Anymore?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah…

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Garm/Loren: We'll both go in here, Garm will take…

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Garm/Loren: Point up here, and look at the… look at the drain.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:05.000
GM: Uh, you two noticed that there seems to be some sort of a brass key or something lodged into the rocks just underneath the grate.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:15.000
GM: If you pried the grate up, you could probably reach it. You guessed that it would probably take about 6 PC rounds to remove the grate with a crowbar.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
GM: Um, and the way a PC round works is one PC would take them 6 rounds if you had.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
GM: 3 PCs working on it, they could do it in 3 rounds.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
GM: I mean, two rounds. Six species can do it in one round.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Garm/Loren: Okay. It was, like, man hours. Yeah, okay. Uh…

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
GM: Yeah.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Garm/Loren: I'll get… uh, yeah, Garm has a crowbar, he'll get it out, and…

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Garm/Loren: Ask Loren to help. Oh, I guess we only have one action between us, though.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah, so Grandma…

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
GM: Yeah.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Garm/Loren: Spend around doing that.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
GM: Does anybody else have crowbars, or is it only Garm with a crowbar?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Garm/Loren: Trying to pry it.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, no, um… let me make sure…

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah, Loren has a grappling hook, I don't know if that…

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Garm/Loren: If you could hook into the top of the, um…

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, uh, Calgalcander has a crowbar.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Garm/Loren: Through the grate.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
GM: And…

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
GM: Is there any… nobody else? There's two crowbars?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Man, people did not come prepared for the…

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah, I mean, I've got grappling hook, I've got spikes.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Ulara/Valaxis: But, uh…

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I have a poll…

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
GM: Alright, um…

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
GM: Yeah, so the two of you, crowbars, you could lift that grate up in 3 rounds.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
GM: And do y'all want me to take around and move everybody into the water room?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
GM: And we'll just advance… advance turns.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, sure.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, let's do that, yeah.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: True, yeah.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
GM: Alright.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'd like to stress here that there's an opportunity for the goblin to be really heroic.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: To shine, right?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: The sperm down that drain, and…

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, like, I… I was waiting for my… for my turn, but I'd say, yeah, like, if, uh…

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Rescue all of us.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: If we want to try that.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
GM: Alright, so that took a turn.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
GM: And, okay, so we ended with, um…

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
GM: That was Garm, so I guess that would then be Philomena's turn.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh…

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
GM: Um, so it… so that was…

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
GM: So then, one round that you spent as everybody's moving, prying it up, so…

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
GM: Um… in 2 more rounds, you can get that grade up.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So we're talking about these.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, these… okay.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
GM: Yeah, there's a key underneath it.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: But, like, uh…

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Is this, like, the, the…

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: where, like, I don't know, something is more like a goblin or a halfling could go into, or…

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
GM: All of the water in this room… so the water is flowing from this area.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Mhm.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
GM: Into this room, and then sort of swirling around, going down into that drain.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Mhm.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, when we were investigating it, yeah, once we get the grade off, the goblin might be able to squirm down the drain.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, ah, okay, okay, but…

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay, okay, now I understand, yeah, like, I thought the…

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I was picturing something else.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Um…

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I… I don't know, like, it's…

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I guess, uh…

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I guess I'll wait, and uh… I don't know, I take, like, uh…

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sergei takes out the…

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, the arrow, like, the shortbow and the arrow, and aims it, uh…

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Here, like…

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
GM: Okay.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: In case anything shows up.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
GM: Alexis?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Unless I can help with a pole or spikes.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Finally…

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Getting the grade up.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: They'll just go over here and keep an eye out down that passage.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
GM: Okay, and…

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
GM: And then I'm back to Born, um…

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, basically, everyone's working on the grape right now, right?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
GM: Uh, two people with the crowbars are on the grate.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright, I'll go here…

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Illuminate more of that.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
GM: So…

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.000
GM: Uh… you can't see too much from where you are, other than the water is coming into the round room from that area.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.000
GM: Um, it looks like the ceiling in the room that you're looking into is, uh, fairly low, uh, like.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
GM: cramped. Um…

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hmm…

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
GM: And that's what you can see from where you are.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, and uh, basically, I think Calgalcander is currently working on the grates, so…

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, that's it.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
GM: Yeah. So, um, Scrabble.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: uh…

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Scrubble is…

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Just gotta hang out. Uh, he is…

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Really interested in when this grate comes off, so…

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
GM: Okay.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: He's not… he's not going anywhere.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
GM: Alright, is Garm doing anything other than waiting for it to come open?

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah. That's right.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
GM: Alright, Philomena?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Billing, like, uh, yeah, aiming, uh, with, uh.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
GM: Same thing.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: With a short bowl, yeah.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
GM: Alright, so I guess we'll keep going, and then as we…

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
GM: Get back to, um…

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
GM: Uh, who is it? It's, uh…

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
GM: It's, uh, Calgalcander, and who else had the… who had the other crowbar?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
GM: Garm?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
GM: No. Yes, it was Calgalcander and Garm, those two we're working on. Okay, so…

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
GM: Uh, when it gets to…

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
GM: Um…

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
GM: I guess Garm's turn, then that will come open, so…

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
GM: Garm, it's your turn. You manage to pry open, and the grate comes free.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
GM: James?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Garm/Loren: It comes free. I grab the key.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000
GM: Uh… okay, you now have in your hand a…

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
GM: uh, brass key.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
GM: And I don't…

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
GM: Let me see if I have one.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
GM: I don't have that key, um…

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
GM: I think we can make one real quick here.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Garm/Loren: And then I will move… use my move action to go…

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Garm/Loren: In here.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
GM: Alright…

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
GM: Where did, uh… oh, Garm, you went up into that room?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
GM: Okay, I will give you the key.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
GM: You now have the key, um…

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
GM: So, as you step into this room, um…

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
GM: Similar to the other one, it's, it's the, it's the, the, um…

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:58.000
GM: Knee-deep water. As you move in, you notice that there… the water is actually moving over large bones that are…

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
GM: Sort of littered over the stone floor, and a slow.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
GM: Current is steadily moving towards.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
GM: Um, that round room that you came out of.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000
GM: Um, the ceiling is very low, uh, cramped. Um, you being a dwarf, it's not such a hindrance for you.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
GM: Um, a regular human probably would be close to scraping their head, um…

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
GM: And…

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
GM: Yeah.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
GM: Philomena.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So you're doing, like, uh…

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Go here, like, to the…

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Where the grid has been removed, and she, like, puts the ad inside to see if there is something else.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:52.000
GM: Um, you put your head in there, and water, uh, fills your nostrils, um, because your head is, like, sticking down and the water's flowing there, but you don't see anything else in here.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Not the brightest of the bunch, either, this year, I guess.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh…

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Both of them move…

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Here.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
GM: Oh, you're not gonna go into the drain?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, I mean…

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Could crawl through the drain and rescue us all.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: You'd be the hero.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.000
GM: Uh, Alexis. When you get… do you do anything when you're… get into this room? Other… are you looking around, or…

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Can you just give me, like, a very quick, uh…

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: like, uh…

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, a recap of what is here.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000
GM: Yeah, so it's knee-deep water, like any other thing. There's large bones, uh, on the floor in this.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:58.000
GM: Uh, the water is moving towards the round room where you came from. Um, I should mention this area up here is sort of like a waterfall.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
GM: Um, it's… it's a… like a pipe in the ceiling, um, that's tumbling straight down.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
GM: into this room. Um, behind that is, uh, like, a ledge or something.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
GM: Uh, that goes up. Um…

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, no, I'll pass, like, for now.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
GM: Alright, palaxis?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay…

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um, somewhere…

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah, look at this thing.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Come down near where that pipe comes out, and…

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Try to look at the area.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh…

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Back behind it.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, so…

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Ulara/Valaxis: The pipe is… is this waterway…

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Where the water's coming out, or is there something…

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Or is the, like, right here where the parts come in?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000
GM: So the… so there's… yeah, the pipe is coming down from the ceiling.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
GM: Um, and the water is coming straight down.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
GM: Um, and…

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:35.000
GM: And so that's like the waterfall that's coming out here, but this passage continues, uh, underneath the water into here.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
GM: So, think if there's a pipe going down.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
GM: And that water is hitting into this passage and then flowing to the north to where you guys are.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000
GM: And… and as you're looking at the water, you do, um, notice that, um…

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
GM: Um…

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
GM: You need… you see some small spots where the water seems to be moving against the flow.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
GM: Like, it seems odd.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Within where it's coming down, or up that passageway?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
GM: Where you're looking over here.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
GM: Where that water's coming down, and the water's flowing out.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
GM: You saw what looks to be almost like some of the water had moved in a different direction.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Like, something…

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
GM: against the flow.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Ulara/Valaxis: In it, or something?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Ulara/Valaxis: We're… something's…

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
GM: Something was, was in there, the water was moving.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
GM: Um, contrary to what you would expect it to move, given the flow of the water.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I'll make people aware of that.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mhm.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
GM: Alright, um…

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
GM: So, okay…

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
GM: So, from where you were looking…

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
GM: This, uh, puddle-like thing, uh, starts to…

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
GM: Sort of swarm, swim, move…

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
GM: forward, um…

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
GM: And, uh…

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
GM: Moves…

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
GM: Uh, here…

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
GM: Seemingly drawn to the motion of…

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
GM: Um…

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
GM: Oh, wait, no, um…

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
GM: Was it, uh… was it Velaxis?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
GM: Yes, okay, yeah, so it moves near to Valaxis.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
GM: And whips out, um, uh, this sort of pseudopod.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
GM: And, uh… attacks, and hits him, tries to hit him with it.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
GM: And… does not manage to hit, um…

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:25.000
GM: And it, uh, its pseudopod sinks back into the water. It's very difficult to see, because it's very translucently watercolored. So, born.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
GM: What's Born doing?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um…

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Let's see, there's a bunch of people down there.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Did anyone ever go in the grate?

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
GM: Uh, Sirzig stuck his head down there.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mhm.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, we think it's wide enough for a goblin, but he did not try to crawl through the drain.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Warren is going to explore that great.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
GM: Uh, you see the water rushing down. Um…

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
GM: It's clear to you, you would not fit down the grate.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Well, that's disappointing.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
GM: Scrabble.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um…

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Hmm…

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Not thrilled about whatever it is that's going on, uh, to the…

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Southwest.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Drift in that direction a little bit.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: But I'm not eager to, uh, go any further.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: at this time.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
GM: Alright, and… Garm.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Also, Born's torch went out, so we are down to a single torch.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And it is pretty dark back here.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
GM: No, James is Garm's turn.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Garm/Loren: It's just coming down into the room, right? So this is, like, above us.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:03.000
GM: Uh, no, this is… it's… it slopes a little bit up, so the water flows into this direction.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
GM: But…

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:15.000
GM: behind where the water's coming down, it, like, looks like it opens up into another… another room or something, but it's not wet back there, from what you can tell. I mean, it's cascading water, sort of.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Garm/Loren: So we walked up there.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
GM: Making it a little blurry, but…

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, would the water put out my torch? Is there a way for me to…

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Garm/Loren: Pulled my torture out of the water.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
GM: No, you figure that water probably would put it out.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
GM: It's a, you know, it's coming down.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, uh…

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:40.000
GM: I'll say if you… if you run under there very quickly and try to shield it, there's a 1 in 6 chance that it will stay lit.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And it's our only torch, so…

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Only lit… yeah.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
GM: It's your only lit torch. You have 5 torches.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Garm/Loren: Okay. Um…

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Garm/Loren: Right, I guess…

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Garm/Loren: Grant will…

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Garm/Loren: Oh, the ooze might put out the torch, actually.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Garm/Loren: Can Loren…

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Garm/Loren: Come up and whack it with a grappling hook.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
GM: Uh, sh… sure.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
GM: Treated as a club.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Garm/Loren: Is the club strength?

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
GM: Uh, yeah, it's a melee attack.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Mhm.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
GM: Uh, yeah, that hits.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
GM: 4 points, uh, D4 damage.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Garm/Loren: One pointed image.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, and Garm…

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Garm/Loren: We'll move back.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
GM: Philomena.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
GM: Andrea, you're on mute.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sorry, sorry. So the creature is dead, right?

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
GM: Correct.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Now.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
GM: No, it's not dead. It's not dead.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
GM: Oh, wait, why does it show a dead?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
GM: Hey, what?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
GM: That was not correct. Um…

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
GM: There. It is still alive.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, uh, Certzig moves, uh, here, and, uh…

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Schroeder with the…

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: short to the Lakers, right?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
GM: Did you shoot at it?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, yeah.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
GM: Okay?

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
GM: That hits for 2 points.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
GM: And Voxis.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, Ulara, actually, will be the one trying to…

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Take a shot at it, or…

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Melee it with the dagger.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So…

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
GM: That also hits.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
GM: And…

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000
GM: It is going to, again… let's see, who's around it? It's Malaxis, Alara…

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
GM: Garm and Loren.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
GM: Yeah, because, again, to attack Velaxis…

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
GM: That is a hit, 3 points of damage, and I think Volaxis falls.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yep.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
GM: Born.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
GM: Jason?

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
GM: Jason.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
GM: Alright, move on to Scrabble.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um…

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well…

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm kind of figuring out.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That, uh…

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Whatever this thing is, uh, to the south.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: It doesn't seem to be as tough as I was afraid it would be, so…

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, firmly, uh, touching my…

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well…

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm going to…

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Charged down there.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And take a swing at it.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
GM: Alrighty.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
GM: That hits for 2 points of damage.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
GM: And… Garm.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, uh…

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Garm/Loren: Loren will take another swing.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
GM: That does not hit.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Garm/Loren: Okay. Uh, and then Garm…

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Garm/Loren: Go back away…

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Garm/Loren: 12? Probably it's pretty good.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Garm/Loren: No, no stable machines.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
GM: And… Philomena.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
GM: That hits it as well.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
GM: And…

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
GM: Uh… let's see…

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
GM: Whose is going to… let's see, we've got Loren…

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: No, no, uh…

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
GM: Go ahead.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: My character still gets attacked. Ulara is still there, so…

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
GM: Oh, your new character, right, okay, um…

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
GM: So wait, let's… let's do this. Hold on. So let me remove phylaxis.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
GM: Which I can't do…

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
GM: But let's add… let's see if I can add Ullara.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
GM: There we go…

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
GM: Um, we'll set Olara's to…

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
GM: Uh, it was…

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Saying it's a 3 or 2.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
GM: There we go, initiative…

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
GM: It's 3…

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
GM: Alright, so back up…

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
GM: And…

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Sorry.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
GM: Yeah, so, um…

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Ulara/Valaxis: There.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
GM: Loren's turn.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
GM: Oh, that does hit, um…

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
GM: Oh. Oh, that was with a dagger.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
GM: Hmm, okay.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
GM: You're the only person that was hitting it with a dagger, right?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I think so, yeah.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
GM: Alright. It's dead.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
GM: Isolar gonna take any movement?

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, is it dead there?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
GM: is dead.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, um…

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I'll step up and…

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Sort of carve it up a little bit with the dagger to see if there was anything inside it.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
GM: Uh, nope.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, and then look around, see if there's anything else that seems…

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Any other funny movement to the water in here?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:12.000
GM: You don't notice that… you do notice that the bones that are been… that are on the ground upon closer inspection, they look, like, to be humanoid.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
GM: And they're completely clean.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah. See if there's any loot underneath them?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
GM: Uh, no loot.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
GM: Um… born.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
GM: Jason, you there?

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
GM: Scrabble.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh…

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: just for a good measure, I'm gonna grope around in the water and grab, you know.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: A tibia, or a femur.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Some nice, uh, you know, humanoid bone.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um…

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, and then…

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: works or anything, I don't have anything…

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Useful to do at this point.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I guess…

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
GM: Okay.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, oh, and, um, can, uh, my other character was Moet, catch up with us?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
GM: Garm?

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I think he's back in the circular room.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Great, thank you.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
GM: Alright, Garm?

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Garm/Loren: Guess I'll send Loren through.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
GM: Alright, so the torchlight doesn't…

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
GM: Make it through into this room very well.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
GM: Um…

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Garm/Loren: She'll stay as much in the leg as she can.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
GM: Okay. Um, you do hear the sound of, like.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000
GM: Water dropping, um, onto the floor, and…

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
GM: Um…

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
GM: They… they… they… it sounds like there's the water, it's, like, dripping.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
GM: You know, like, the sound of dripping from a ceiling, but it…

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.000
GM: It… when it hits, instead of hearing a plop, it's like a hiss.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
GM: Because you see a couple of drops, um…

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
GM: Uh, in front of you. Um…

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
GM: Philomena.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: You know what, I want to take another…

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, look at the gear, like, the…

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: the… the grade there. They call, like.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Whatever was, like, below, like, that passage.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So, like, basically, if I enter, like, with, uh.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: If I enter with my face, I just feel water.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:09.000
GM: Yeah, there's water going down, um, next to you. Like, if you go head first, you know, the water gets into your nose, and…

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
GM: And everything, because it's sort of, you know, flowing past you.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, like, but do I feel, like, I can feel, like, the, like, the ground, I guess, at some point, like, if I…

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000
GM: Are you gonna go down in? Are you gonna try to shimmy down the hole?

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Mmm…

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, like, I mean, like, I would like to do it in a way that, uh, where, like, I…

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I can, um, maybe hold…

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like a…

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I'm trying to think, like, maybe I…

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I hold with my hands, like, the…

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Upper part of the…

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: of the hall, and I tried to…

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, uh… with my, like, to…

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: To fill with my feet, like, how the ground is.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Below. Doesn't make sense.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:11.000
GM: Alright, so you, like, you wanna, you wanna go into the hole and sort of, like, try to dangle from the rim?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
GM: Uh, yeah, you can try that.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Mhm.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sure, I do that.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000
GM: Okay, so you're hanging down, the water is sort of flowing over you, so…

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
GM: Uh, go ahead and make a…

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
GM: DC12 strength check.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay…

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:40.000
GM: No, make it a DC9. It's not tons of water, it's… it's not so much a DC9 strength.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:52.000
GM: Yeah, you're dangling, um, you're holding on, uh, your feet do not feel to be like they're touching the ground or anything.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.000
GM: Like, this pipe or drain continues on, you know, further below you, although you're only a few feet tall, so…

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
GM: That's not saying much.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Maybe, can I, like…

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Maybe I can ask Aquilomena, like, to hold me with it.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, uh, with, uh, her arms, and, uh, like, lower me a bit further.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Thank you.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000
GM: Um, okay, so you're… you're… while you're in the hole now, it's… you're… you can't breathe.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
GM: Um…

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
GM: So, if you… are you… are you…

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, like, I cannot even communicate, uh… yeah, I guess I came out, like, I cannot even communicate, I suppose, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
GM: Going to come out of the hole?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
GM: Okay.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
GM: Okay. Mara?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So, yeah.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um, I will…

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Ulara/Valaxis: licked body of Alexis, including pulling his tunic off.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And then go step over here.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Can I use the tunic to deflect enough of the…

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: You know, a section of the water coming down from the pipe.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So that, uh, it'd be possible for someone to get passed.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Ulara/Valaxis: With the torch and keep it burning?

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:12.000
GM: Um, hold on, so… for a sec, so you're taking all of Alexis's gear?

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah. A grappling hook, an oil flask, and a dagger.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
GM: Okay…

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
GM: Yep. Gave you all that.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
GM: And then, what are you going to do to deflect the water?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So, using Laxis's tunic.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Just… you know…

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Trying to hold it up on the side of…

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Ulara/Valaxis: You know, where the water's coming down out of the pipe.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: To try and get a clear area along the side.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Ulara/Valaxis: That someone could bring the torch.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, sir.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
GM: Yeah, that will… it'll improve the odds from a 1 in 6 to a 50-50.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, but it's dark now.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, Garm's torch.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
GM: Ah, yes, it just went out. So…

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
GM: Is Ular gonna do anything else?

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, I don't have anything else to do.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: stuff with. I don't have a torch, or Li…

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Flint and steel.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
GM: Alright.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:16.000
GM: Uh-huh. And, uh, let's see, no… nothing seems to be coming to get you yet. Born.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, so, there's no light.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
GM: Nope, it's completely darkness.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Well, that's fun.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Let's see…

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay… uh…

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Does Calgalcander have flint?

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Born/Calgalcandar: uh… a…

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
GM: Calgalcander does not.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: A wire torch.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000
GM: Calgalcander doesn't have Flint, Born doesn't have Flint.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Does anyone have flat?

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Grebel has flint and steel, yes.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, where are you at?

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:15.000
GM: So… so you call out to see if anybody has flint and steel, and Scrabble, you respond that you do?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yep.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, in south, next to the waterfall.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
GM: So you can meet…

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:25.000
GM: Yeah, so you can make… Born, you can… you hear his voice, and you can make your way towards the sound of his voice.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Mm, mm.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
GM: And, uh…

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
GM: You can attempt to take.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.000
GM: uh, the flint and steel from Scrabble. Scrabble, to do this, you're gonna need to make a…

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.000
GM: Uh, DC9 DEX check to see if you can successfully get it into his hand without dropping it into the water.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
GM: at disadvantage.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, come on.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Okay.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Disadvantage?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
GM: Yeah, everything in the dark is a disadvantage.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Okay, that makes sense.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So… Dex check at disadvantage, right?

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
GM: Yep, just for Scrabble, because he's trying to hand it to you.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, okay.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
GM: And that does not work.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oops.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, that's unfortunate.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, wait a second. Uh, I'm sorry, I messed up. Uh, it's WASMOET that has, I think.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Wind and steel, not Scrabble. My bad.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
GM: Alright, well, let me just say that you went to… Born went to WASMOT instead.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: What's my other character?

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, fortunately, if I remember correctly, WASMOET actually has two sets of linton steel.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000
GM: Alright, so we'll say that there was WASMUT that tried to give it to Born.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
GM: Um…

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
GM: Scrambling.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh… hmm…

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well, given that we are in utter darkness.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Grebel…

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Really has nothing useful.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: contribute right now. Scrabble's just gonna stay where he is.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, Wozmowet will try to hand off his other flint dispute.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Why don't you just try music? Mm-hmm.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:21.000
GM: Alright, um… okay, so Scrabble's not doing anything, Wazmut is going to try to hand the flint and steel to Born?

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes. Uh, oh.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
GM: Alright, go ahead and make that roll.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
GM: Ducks check at disadvantage.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, alright. Yeah, I…

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Since I can't see Wasmoët's token, I can't…

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Select him to do the DEX check.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.000
GM: Oh, right, um…

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
GM: How do we do that? Um…

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
GM: Oh, I think I probably have to roll it for you.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Can't you do it from the character sheet? Like, in the… like a…

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
GM: Yeah, can't you double-click on the character sheet?

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I… I can't get to the sheet.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, go to under Actors.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
GM: Oh, double-click right here.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, under actors, right, right, right.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
GM: Yeah, actors, that'll do it too.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks for reminding me.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, so…

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: X.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
GM: DC9 DeX disadvantage.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Disadvantage…

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Ooh, bad.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
GM: No, not yet.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Real bad.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
GM: Philomena.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, uh, I mean, Philomena was supposed to be over there, I guess, but anyway, like, she moves, uh, still, uh, here.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And, uh, uh…

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, like, she hears, uh…

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, all this about, uh…

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, no, it's Sergei as Flint and Steel, like, Sergei hears about Flint and Steel, comes.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: around the area where, uh, like, years, like, uh, deals like, I have some, I have some, and I'm gonna try to pass it.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: to my…

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Just start using it to cast parts. And once you start doing that.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Have him bring the torch there.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Ulara/Valaxis: No passing.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Right.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000
GM: So, to light a torch is a DC12 decks at disadvantage.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Let's go. Oh, and this is Filomen, sorry, I'm gonna go with Serzig.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, nope.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
GM: And… Polara.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um, I'm gonna head over towards where I see sparks.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And then dig around on the ground to see if I can find the stuff that got dropped.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So… DEX check at disadvantage of DC…

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
GM: Okay, so hold on. So, Sergei, you dropped to Flint and Steel?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Ulara/Valaxis: But what happened when they didn't pass it successfully?

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
GM: Well, I think they'd, um…

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
GM: Oh, okay, wait, yeah, so there was one attempt to pass one.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
GM: And that was, uh, Sirzig's?

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
GM: No, that was WASMOT, right?

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, Wozmoit. Wasmo, it made 2 attempts.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
GM: Okay, so the flint and steel down here, that was Wasmoët's?

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
GM: Okay.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
GM: And then… but so he had 2 flint and steels?

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, he did. Bizarrely enough.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
GM: Okay, but he's dropped them both.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So…

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
GM: Okay.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Going to where I heard them trying to pass it and trying to search on the ground.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000
GM: Alright, um, it's… so they're… they're underwater, uh, that's… let's do, um…

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Word.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:55.000
GM: Uh, they're small, two pieces, that's a DC15 at disadvantage. Um…

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.000
GM: Make that a… wisdom check.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, Wisdom? Sorry.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
GM: Yeah.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
GM: Nope.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
GM: Uh, hold on…

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000
GM: Alright, no monsters coming to get you born.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, can Born make… so, basically, flint and steel is somewhere around Born, right?

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
GM: Uh, somewhere in the room, yeah.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
GM: DC15 Wisdom at disadvantage to try to find it?

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, here we go!

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Prepare to be dazzled.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, yeah.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
GM: Mm-hmm. Scrabble?

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh…

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Hearing everyone, uh, you know, pursing in the dark and sort of narrating what they're doing.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um, I'm gonna get in on the, uh, the search for the, the lost, uh.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
GM: Okay.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, flint and steel.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000
GM: So you splash around in the water, um…

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Let's see if I can…

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I dropped my contacts!

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yep.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, you said it was a DC-15 wisdom check? A disadvantage?

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
GM: Yeah, at disadvantage.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
GM: No.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Ugh.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
GM: Garm.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Garm/Loren: I don't have anything to light with.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Garm/Loren: So, I think I passed my turn.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
GM: You're not gonna try to find the flint and steel?

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Garm/Loren: It dropped? Okay. Yeah, I'll poll around for it.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.000
GM: There's two of them on the floor, so you could do a DC15 wisdom check at disadvantage to see if you can.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
GM: Root around and find them.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
GM: Find one of them.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Born/Calgalcandar: It seems like if two of them are on the floor, we would get this at a normal.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:43.000
GM: Yeah, I don't think so. Not when you're talking about them being dropped in a 30 by, you know, 20-foot room.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
GM: That's covered in water.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Born/Calgalcandar: uh, details.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
GM: Philomena.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I have another Flint and steel, I'm gonna try to spark it to…

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000
GM: Alright, that's a DC12 decks at disadvantage.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
GM: Jeez.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Ah, okay.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
GM: Loren.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, continuing my…

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Attempt to find…

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Flint and Steel.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
GM: Nope. Closer.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
GM: Almost.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mhm.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
GM: Hmm…

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
GM: Oh, that's interesting, um…

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
GM: Uh, Loren…

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
GM: notices…

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
GM: Um…

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000
GM: That there's… at her feet, there is a small puddle.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
GM: Um…

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
GM: It is a…

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
GM: Right.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
GM: It has a whitish color to it.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Is it glowing?

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
GM: Um…

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
GM: Oh, that's right, there's no light in here. Um…

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Born/Calgalcandar: How can I even tell it's white?

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:02.000
GM: It does give off a very, very faint glow, just enough to notice it.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
GM: Uh, it's Born's turn.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Do I see this phosphorescent puddle?

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
GM: Um, not from where you are, no.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I…

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I guess Born will make another attempt.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Born/Calgalcandar: To find the two flint and steel that is dropped.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Somewhere in this room.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Ullara will try to get born.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Next to her, so that they're sort of working together to try and.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: You know, instead of sweeping over where somebody else was and that sort of thing.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: to serve.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Try to find a way of increasing our odds here.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
GM: Uh…

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
GM: Alright, so where…

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
GM: Born, where are you searching?

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… somewhere in this room.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000
GM: Alright, so Ilara is… so, Ilara, you're gonna… you're gonna help Born?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will try… yes, I want to try and… yes.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will try and help you.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.000
GM: Okay, so that's what's going to take your action. Born, you can make a DC15 wisdom Check regular.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, here we go!

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Boom!

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
GM: Scrabble.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, so do… is Scrabble in a position to see the phosphorescent.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: blob, uh…

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.000
GM: No, because it's incredibly faint, and it's through the rushing water coming out of the ceiling.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Okay, alright. Well, in that case, um…

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, I, uh…

02:09:52.000 --> 02:10:00.000
GM: I mean, it's… it's barely even… it's just enough to see that kind of whitish reflection of the slime puddle.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Alright, uh, so Scrabble's gonna continue, uh, groping around for the, uh…

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
GM: Alright.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: What?

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Ah, so close.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
GM: Garm.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
GM: Ilamina.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Searching for the…

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Greater Steel.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay…

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Finally, finally!

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.000
GM: Oh, you found the flint and steel. Um…

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, no! Oh, was she looking, or was she, like, trying to, like…

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
GM: She was searching, yeah.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I'm searching.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.000
GM: And so, let me give you one.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
GM: There you go, you now have a flint and steel. That was your turn, though.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
GM: And it is now Ulara.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Can… I try to…

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Help Philomena get the torch slit for next turn.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.000
GM: No. You used your tur- you used your turn to help, um.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, you're right, that's… that's… yeah, so…

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
GM: Yeah.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Not doing anything this turn then, sorry.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
GM: Okay.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
GM: Oop, hold on one second…

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
GM: Ready to go, ready to go, there we go.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
GM: Okay. No encounter.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
GM: Born.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… so, someone can light this torch now, right?

02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.000
GM: Somebody does have a… I think two people have a flint and steel at this point, so you're gonna have two opportunities.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, let's… let's go for it.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
GM: Aren't you? Or is it only one?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I think it's only one.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, like, I…

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
GM: Oh.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
GM: Yeah, okay.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, it…

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.000
GM: So, that's gonna be, um…

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000
GM: Yeah, so Philomena will be able to try to light it.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So what do I do?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
GM: What do you want to do?

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I want to light this torch.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000
GM: You don't have the means.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Help somebody find the other Flint and steel.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, yeah, I will make an attempt to find the remaining flint and steel.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
GM: Okay.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Or… or help Scrabble do it, or something, yeah.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Here we go.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
GM: Nah. Scrabble.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh…

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh… let's try to find the remaining…

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
GM: Okay.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Remaining for what?

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.000
GM: Nope, just Mrs. Garm.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Too close.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
GM: Is Garm gonna search?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Garm/Loren: Yes.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Garm/Loren: Until he finds what he's looking for.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Garm/Loren: Not this time.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:53.000
GM: Nope. Alright, Philomena, it's a DC12 decks check at disadvantage to Light born's Torch.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Here we go.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
GM: No!

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Holy shit, okay.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: What, like, I mean, sorry, just a second, like, if we move…

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, like, now I lost again, like, the Finneas still, I suppose.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000
GM: No. No, no, you still have it.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Right? No? Okay.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: No.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay, okay.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um, I will…

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Call for where Scrabble is, and try to assist Scrabble in finding the other flint and steel.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
GM: Okay.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000
GM: Born? Uh, wait. Not yet. It's me…

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So…

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Apparently, yeah.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.000
GM: See if the creepy crawlies are coming yet. Oh, nope, you got lucky again.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
GM: Born?

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I'm getting my antsy here.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Born/Calgalcandar: It's dark.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright… wait.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Born/Calgalcandar: It's time to see the abilities of my better half.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, good lord, no.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, I'm making an attempt.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Wait, yeah, I'm making an attempt to find the other flint and steel.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
GM: Alright.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Here we go!

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
GM: Ooh…

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
GM: Gravel.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So Scrabble should do this even, right?

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And…

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
GM: Yep.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, yep.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Right.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Come on!

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
GM: No!

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: The RNG really hates us tonight, yeah.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
GM: Thought that was gonna hit 18.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
GM: Garm, you gonna search?

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
GM: Is Garm gonna roll to search, James?

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Or can you help?

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Or can you try and help Philomena light the torch?

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
GM: There you go.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
GM: Is Garm gonna do that? Assist?

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Garm/Loren: Yes.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:38.000
GM: Alright. Philomena, you go ahead and roll to light the torch, DC12 Wisdom, but this will be a regular… I mean, a Dexterity, but this will be a regular roll, because…

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
GM: Uh, Garm is helping you.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
GM: He's holding the torch really still.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
GM: Wow, okay!

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Not going off!

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Help scramble again.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
GM: You're not the most agile bunch.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
GM: You're gonna help again?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yep.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
GM: You're… you're helping, um, Scrabble?

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Travel.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
GM: Born.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
GM: Is Loren doing anything with that puddle, by the way? I was just looking at it, the slime puddle.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Garm/Loren: Loren has…

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Garm/Loren: Is there a sliding puddle at the base of her feet?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:59.000
GM: Yeah, so right, right down there. She's very faintly glowing white patch of slime on the floor.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Garm/Loren: I think she's gonna wait until she's joined by her compatriots.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
GM: Alright.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Again, can I see this faint glowing light?

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
GM: No.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.000
GM: I mean, it's almost as if you have to look at it, like, with your eyes averted to even see it.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Warren's getting creeped out here.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Born/Calgalcandar: You will make one more attempt!

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Born/Calgalcandar: To get the flint and steel.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
GM: No…

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.000
GM: Scrabble. Now, I believe that…

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
GM: Uh, Loren's helping you, yes?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes. Alright.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:04.000
GM: Alright, so… DC12 decks with…

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Scrabble.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, no, I still…

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
GM: Oh, no, you're searching. That's right.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah. Scrabble ease a long, suffering side, yeah.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
GM: DC15Wiz.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Plunges his hands back into the freezing cold.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: It's black water.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh…

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, finally.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:33.000
GM: All right. So, Scrabble, you get a flint and steel.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
GM: And… Garm.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Garm/Loren: Okay…

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000
GM: Or Loren.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Garm/Loren: Garm has…

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Garm/Loren: a torch…

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Garm/Loren: So I guess I'll pull that out.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Garm/Loren: I'll wait for someone to light their torch.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
GM: Julamina.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
GM: Are you gonna try to light a torch again?

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
GM: Andrea?

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: You're muted, Andrea.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I'm here, I'm trying to light the torch again, yeah? Like, am I being assisted by someone?

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
GM: Uh, alright, Lane Born's torch?

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sorry?

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
GM: You're lighting Born's torch?

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, yeah.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
GM: Okay.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Am I being assisted by someone right now?

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
GM: Uh, nobody said they were helping.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, so I guess it's a disadvantage.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
GM: Yep.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Nope.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000
GM: Nope.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
GM: Bullara.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will aid Scrabble in lighting a torch.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
GM: Warren?

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, so all flint and steel has been acquired now.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
GM: Yes.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Mhm, yes.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Is there any way I can assist… can I light this torch?

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000
GM: Um, you don't have the means.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Ulara/Valaxis: You can assist Philomena.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Right?

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.000
GM: Philomena has a flint and steel, and…

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: the board…

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright, I will help someone bite this torch.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
GM: Okay. Scrabble.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, so Ulara and I are going to try to light Born's torch.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
GM: Alright.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
GM: Come on!

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
GM: Can do it.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Good guy.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So annoying.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
GM: crammed.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Garm/Loren: Um…

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
GM: You have a torch, right?

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Garm/Loren: Sounded like someone needed help lighting a torch. I guess I will help them.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.000
GM: Yeah, you could help Philomena help, uh, Philomena light Bjorn's torch.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Garm/Loren: Yes.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000
GM: Philomena.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: No.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
GM: Uh, you know what?

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:52.000
GM: The gods have been standing above, looking at this play out.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Alright, I don't know, you…

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:59.000
GM: They finally take pity and give you a luck token that worked to light the damn torch.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, can we take a short break?

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
GM: Yeah, let's, let's do that.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
GM: Oh, God.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
GM: We would have been here all night.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, that was painful, man.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Ulara/Valaxis: That right? Yes.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, so can we have metal on it.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Ulara/Valaxis: How many are left in that?

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Ulara/Valaxis: thing. On the street.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Ulara/Valaxis: A little bit less than half.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I have to open the treats.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Ulara/Valaxis: That's the same type of material, she's broken into.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah, but do you have a bungee cord, or a… Okay, no, Amber?

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: That's really… that's…

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: She's gonna freight that! That's gonna freak the class.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I put it in here on binding cornered clothes.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So, wait, hold on, can I…

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Nope, doesn't like it.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yep. One of the bungee cords out of the garage, and…

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay. It does fit.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Maybe this will work.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes, it is.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:59.000
GM: Alright, if we're back, I think it's still ours turn.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, we've got a light now and everything else, um…

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will…

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Actually, the game's paused, so…

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
GM: Mmm, there we go.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, I will move back over here to try and deflect.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Some of the water, and then have the person with the unlit torch walk through.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And lighted on the other side.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.000
GM: Okay, so that's going to be…

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.000
GM: Let's do a quick report here.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
GM: Alright.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
GM: So, it looks like Garm, Loren.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
GM: Born…

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
GM: have torches.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, Loren's got a short server in that site?

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
GM: Yep.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So some… we just need somebody with flint and steel to go over there to light it.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
GM: Yep.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:32.000
GM: Are you gonna then wait there for Born to come with his lit torch to try to get him through?

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um, I will, but I'd rather have another torch lit first before he comes through.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:42.000
GM: Okay. Is anybody else back? Uh, born?

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
GM: Jason? Be on mute if you're back.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yup.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Garm/Loren: Jason Born?

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yep. It's born is here.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
GM: So you're gonna wait until, um…

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.000
GM: somebody with a flint and steel gets across and lights Loren's torch before moving over through the water?

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, where's Lorne?

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Our side of the waterfall.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
GM: Loren's over here.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… couldn't I just move up with my lid torch and…

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And have a 50-50 chance of it going out.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
GM: there's a…

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, why? Oh.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Is there something because of the water?

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:40.000
GM: Yeah, there's a pipe overhead that's gushing water, that's where all this water's coming from, so you'd have to walk under it.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yeah, I won't do that.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, I will wait.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
GM: Alright, so…

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
GM: Scrabble?

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, Scrabble is going to…

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I guess this is what they call nominative determinism?

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Right? Scramble his way through the waterfall.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, up to Loren, and attempt to light her torch with his wind and steel.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:20.000
GM: Alright, that's just automatic, so…

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:26.000
GM: And as her torch comes alight.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Hmm. Yeah.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
GM: Um…

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: What do we see?

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
GM: You see, in this room…

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
GM: Irregular drips, um…

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:44.000
GM: Uh, dripping from the tips of dagger-like stalactites, uh, and as they land and hit the ground, they make a soft hissing sound, like…

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
GM: Um…

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Seems bad.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
GM: And you also notice, right here.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000
GM: A, uh, small, uh, puddle of white slime.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Also seems bad.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Put your hand in it.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Slime and acid.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Great combination.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: How did I wind up at the front?

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Wasn't part of the plan.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Definitely was not pertable.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Healing slime.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh…

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well, I am…

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: not thrilled about all this driplic acid. I don't really want to move any further into this room, so I'm gonna…

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Just kind of… I've done my good deed, I've lit the torch.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
GM: Okay.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm just going to kind of edge to the side here and leave the passageway clear behind me.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
GM: Garm.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
GM: James, it's Garm and or Loren's turn.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Garm/Loren: I have to investigate.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Garm/Loren: The pile, or the…

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
GM: The puddle?

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Garm/Loren: The puddle, yes.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:31.000
GM: Um, yeah, it's a, it's a…

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Garm/Loren: Drag… drag the tip of her grappling hook through the…

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Garm/Loren: Through the sparkling bits.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
GM: Yeah, nothing happens.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:50.000
GM: Alright, um, you make your way in, and then you see…

02:35:51.000 --> 02:36:00.000
GM: Here on the, uh, southern wall, uh, there's a corpse lying next to, uh, like a fat backpack.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
GM: Uh, sitting right next to it.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:05.000
GM: And, uh, go ahead and make a DC12 DEX check.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.000
GM: Alright, um, so as these drops are coming down.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:22.000
GM: You managed to, uh, dodge them. Um, none of them touched you.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Garm/Loren: They appear to be acidic.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:32.000
GM: Um, you… do you want to reach out and try to touch one?

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Garm/Loren: Basic.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, no, I don't think I will experiment with my skin.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.000
GM: Alright, uh, is that your turn, then?

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Garm/Loren: I'll open the backpack if I can.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000
GM: Uh, oh, then you would have wanted to move here.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Garm/Loren: Oh, it's…

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
GM: It's the southern wall.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Garm/Loren: Sorry, I thought Southern Wall Net here.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.000
GM: Nope.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
GM: So the corpse is kind of, like, right here.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, yeah, and I'll just look through the backpack.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:12.000
GM: Okay, so, um, yeah, the corpse looks to be, like, uh, it was a dwarf, um, but by the state of the body, it looks like it's probably been here for several months.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:17.000
GM: Um, and you notice that there's a hole bored into the top of his skull.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
GM: Um, he has a staff in one hand.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000
GM: Um, and a polished piece of, uh, looks some kind of a hardened.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:33.000
GM: like, black ooze or something in his other hand. Um, and, uh, the backpack, uh, you open that up.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Garm/Loren: Mhm.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
GM: Um, you find a scroll.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
GM: Um, do you take the scroll?

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Garm/Loren: Yes.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:53.000
GM: And you also get to roll 2 times.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000
GM: On the random gear chart, so let me…

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:00.000
GM: Keep that back there so you can do it.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000
GM: Uh, so you should see in the chat the ability to click that button.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Garm/Loren: Yes.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.000
GM: Alright, so you get a club and another flint and steel.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Garm/Loren: All right.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Garm/Loren: Very good.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
GM: And… Philomena.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Moving here…

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: To see what's going on.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:52.000
GM: Yep, and you also see the little drops coming down and hissing as they land on the ground.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Hmm…

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, gosh, I got to…

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: a little closer, like, I don't see anything else from here.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000
GM: Alright, as you step into the room, make a DC12 DEX check.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I don't know why it's not S.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I got it from my…

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Dr. Sheet.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hm.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Ouch.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.000
GM: Okay, um…

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: you die.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, I suppose.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.000
GM: Yeah, Philomena is gonna take 2 points of damage.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Bye, Philomena.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
GM: dies.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: We hardly knew thee.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
GM: Alright, um…

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
GM: Lara.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Hey guys, is it worth it for everybody to head that way, or are we going to want to go back and go a different direction?

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, there's passageways down here.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um, you know, I think if we want to press on.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:22.000
GM: Yeah, looks like there's an exit.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000
GM: Exit to the, uh, north, uh, east.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will…

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Continue blocking the water so that, uh.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Because Born's got the other torch, and give him the best chance of getting through.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
GM: No.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
GM: Alright.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
GM: Um…

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000
GM: So, born, you gonna try to make it through there?

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hell… no.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
GM: Oh, okay.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Well, we've got a lit torch on the other side.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yeah, that's nice. Uh, Born is going to…

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Let's see… 1, 2, 3…

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 4… 5… 6…

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Born/Calgalcandar: That's 37.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright, Warren is going to do this…

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Born/Calgalcandar: And then…

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Splitting the party, that's always a good idea.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Boom.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
GM: Scrabble?

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: uh…

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Wow, I don't like this room. Uh, Scrabble is just gonna…

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: run, uh…

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.000
GM: Alright, make the DC12 DEX check as you go.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Try to make it into…

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Don't make it into that passage.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:01.000
GM: There are no more acid drippies in this passage.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.000
GM: However, you were caught by some acid drippies on the way through.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And dies.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.000
GM: And takes a point of damage, which…

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
GM: Kills you. Yep, you're dead.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, so, uh, Wozmowet, uh, who… oh.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: There's no torch, I can't see his token.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um…

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I think if he double moves…

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.000
GM: Yeah, Wozmoad is in pitch darkness, isn't he?

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, uh…

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I mean, he can see the light on the other side of the waterfall.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: But, uh…

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So if he double moves, he could be…

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I think where Scrabble's body is.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
GM: Yes. Yep.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That's what he'll do.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
GM: Alright.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.000
GM: I'll help you get there, and then go ahead and just make a DC12 DEX.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
GM: And he makes it.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Alright, that was a close one.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Can you drag his token there for me, so I can't see it?

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
GM: Garm.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
GM: Uh, yeah, I put WASMAT there.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Garm/Loren: So, as Loren…

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
GM: He's next to Scrabble.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, okay.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Garm/Loren: As Loren, is there a way for me to avoid the drips? So the drips, like, over here, if I squeeze through here?

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:29.000
GM: Yes, you can… no, they're all over, dripping from this room, so the way you try to avoid them is by.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.000
GM: Dexterously trying to dodge them, which is a DC12 dex check.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, can I put the backpack, like, over my head?

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Garm/Loren: to get advantage?

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.000
GM: Yes, you could try to cover yourself up.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Garm/Loren: Yes. Or, yeah, let me see…

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Garm/Loren: You said there's the… the dead body is like a magician guy, right? Did he have a robe on?

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.000
GM: Uh… well, he's a male dwarf, he has a staff, and he did find a scroll.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Garm/Loren: Oh.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:05.000
GM: So that would be, um, uh, something that you might think of that he would be. So he had a staff in one hand, and then hardened black ooze in another.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, yeah, I'll take the ooze.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, and the staff from M.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Garm/Loren: Um…

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
GM: Alright, let me…

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
GM: Let's see if I can give you the ooze.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Garm/Loren: Is he wearing any kind of clothing?

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
GM: Um…

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:39.000
GM: He is wearing some robes, though they are quite eaten away and really…

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
GM: Bad, bad shape.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Garm/Loren: Um, yeah, I'll, like, hold the backpack above me as a kind of umbrella.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Garm/Loren: Well, I…

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Garm/Loren: go through.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
GM: Alright, hold on just a second…

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
GM: Mhm.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
GM: Alright, here's your ooze.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:26.000
GM: And so go ahead, you can run across and make that check with advantage, because you're holding that heavy.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:29.000
GM: Backpack over your head.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Garm/Loren: Alright! Yay!

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, and we'll…

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
GM: Well, you go back there, okay.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah, yeah, I wanna get out of the acid caves.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
GM: Okay.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
GM: Okay, so there was no acid over here.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
GM: Where everybody else was going.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Garm/Loren: Oh, to the east?

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
GM: Yeah.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
GM: And then is Garm gonna move over there, too?

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Garm/Loren: Yes.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
GM: Okay, you'll have to do the DC12 decks.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, okay, can Loren toss the backpack?

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Garm/Loren: To him?

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
GM: Um…

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:30.000
GM: So I guess there would have been a full move there. Um…

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:43.000
GM: Yeah, you can toss the backpack, it's gonna be, um, a ranged attack to try to hit him.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:53.000
GM: We'll say that, uh, yeah, his A/C is 12, so it's an A/C… a DC12 ranged attack.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
GM: Or you're… so you're attacking against an A/C-12.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:02.000
GM: Okay, yeah, he does get it. So, Garm making these C12…

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Garm/Loren: Garm will make a…

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
GM: an advantage.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Garm/Loren: with the value of decks.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
GM: It does, okay.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Garm/Loren: Emily Bimbly.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
GM: Lara.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Ah, there's… there was a Sir Dzig.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, yes. Philomena and Serze.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.000
GM: Oh, we need to add them to the… Philomena's dead…

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yes.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Born/Calgalcandar: And travel is dead.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
GM: Uh, sip…

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Mhm.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:34.000
GM: I forgot about, so…

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.000
GM: What's… what's been… what's Calvin doing, Jason?

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
GM: He was hanging out over here.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, Calgalcander's Following Born.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
GM: Alright, we'll put that together. So…

02:48:53.000 --> 02:49:00.000
GM: Alright, so… Philomeno's dead, who's the next… so, we need to get Cerzig into the tracker, I think, right?

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yep.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
GM: Alright, and…

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
GM: Jersey…

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: for the role initiative, for that.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.000
GM: No, she also… what was, uh, do you remember what Philomena's was?

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:24.000
GM: She was… she came after Garm, right?

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I think it was 4.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
GM: 4, okay.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
GM: There we go.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
GM: So… yeah.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So…

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
GM: So, Sergzic's turn.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So, Sergei, good…

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: takes, uh, Illumina's body.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And puts, uh, her… her corpse, uh.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: over, uh…

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: His head, like, to cover himself from the…

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: From the acid, and uh…

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
GM: So…

02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.000
GM: Um… let's see…

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
GM: So, Philomena…

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
GM: Let me do this.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:22.000
GM: You would have to spend an action trying to… if you want to try to get her body into that… where you are, without having to touch the acid.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:28.000
GM: you could try using, like, your pole or something to… oh, no, that's Philomena, you don't have a pole, do you?

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: That's what I mean. Yeah, I don't.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
GM: Oh, um…

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.000
GM: Yeah, so you will have to make, um…

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:45.000
GM: You have to make it two checks, because you're a goblin, um…

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
GM: And she's a human.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: No, she's a halfling.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
GM: You're gonna have to be…

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
GM: Oh, is she? Oh.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yep.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
GM: Oh, well, in that case, then…

02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:02.000
GM: Yeah, so then it's two checks. You gotta make a DC9 strength check to hoister and hold her above your head, and…

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
GM: Um…

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:08.000
GM: Yeah, so if you, if you, if you make that…

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:16.000
GM: Um, then you make it through. If you fail that, then you're gonna have to make the DEX check to see if you've dodged the acid.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay, let's go.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: No!

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
GM: No, alright?

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Ooh!

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
GM: DC12 Decks.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I would accept that DC.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:39.000
GM: I could make some… I could make something really bad, like you fall flat on your face, but I won't do that.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mhm.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: The acid burns down through your brain.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Ulara/Valaxis: You skid and fall on top of Philomena, protecting her body.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Ooh!

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
GM: I'm sorry.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: No.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:07.000
GM: Alright, um, then we go to Ulara.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
GM: Who's… who doesn't have a…

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So, Lars…

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
GM: Who doesn't have a PC in play right now?

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Got me. Yeah.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, me, like, uh, right now.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.000
GM: But there's somebody else, because there's only 1, 2, 3…

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Eh, just, just…

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:21.000
GM: players, so we got Jason, Finneny, uh, James.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
GM: And… Correct.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I haven't lost a character yet, because…

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I didn't go down the corridor of death.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, so we need to swap, uh.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: uh, WASMO at for Scrabble.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:37.000
GM: Yep, okay, so… and that's, uh, what was…

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:41.000
GM: And Scrabble's, uh, init was 14, right? So…

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, that's…

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
GM: I will update that.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:52.000
GM: And we will get Scrabble out of there.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:57.000
GM: And… alright, so, Ulara.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I have a tunic that has spent the last several rounds getting soaked fully with water.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
GM: Alright, you can do the…

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
GM: uh, um…

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Driped that over my head, and…

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:11.000
GM: The, uh… yeah, you can do this?

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Then, come up here.

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:15.000
GM: Do you get the advantage on the DC-12?

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: and grab… uh, yeah, I'm just gonna grab Philomena's body.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
GM: Dex.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And drag it behind me on my way over.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So… DC12 decks…

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Ulara/Valaxis: with Advantage.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
GM: And you make it?

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And… with Philomena's body, so we can loot the body.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Ulara/Valaxis: But she's got 2 sets of flint and steel.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.000
GM: Alright. So you loot her body?

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Well, yes, I'll take one set of flint and steel, and then if any… if, uh…

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Ulara/Valaxis: His next character can…

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Very accruing.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.000
GM: Well, Philomena only has one flint and steel.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, I'll still steal it, then.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:19.000
GM: Alright, uh, she also has a short bow and arrows.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Ooh.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Does anybody want that more than somebody with 17 decks?

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:29.000
GM: Oh, wait. I'm sorry, she did have two flint and steels.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh yeah, I don't know where the other one went.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
GM: Yeah, no, she's got… she's… she's got another one on her.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.000
GM: So she currently has a club, a shortbow.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
GM: Uh, arrows, flint, and steel, and a pole.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So, um…

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
GM: Is Wilar taking anything else?

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, and if people don't object, I'll take the, uh…

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Ulara/Valaxis: The flint… sorry, the bow and the arrows, too.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Although I don't see them out, so…

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
GM: Alright, um…

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
GM: Born.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:31.000
GM: Uh… somebody else is missing. Who are we missing? We've got 1, 2, 3, 4…

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
GM: for…

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 3, 4…

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: There's, uh…

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:39.000
GM: Oh, because you don't, uh, you don't have a PC at all, right, Andrea?

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yes, exactly.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:45.000
GM: Okay, so which one do you want to pull in?

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Let me take a look, uh…

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Maybe…

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh, more or less.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: like, uh, VL.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
GM: Okay.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:13.000
GM: Um, so let's say that…

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
GM: Moralette is in this room.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
GM: Uh, you find him…

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
GM: In the corner of this room.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.000
GM: So let's go ahead and add more or less to the tracker.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
GM: Update with…

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:59.000
GM: A… let's see, it's a 4…

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
GM: Mississing…

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:10.000
GM: Alright. So, Born, what are you doing? You okay? You ran out… you're heading out that way?

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, I've already done it. Yeah.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:14.000
GM: Okay, cool. Then it's, uh, WASMWIT.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, so Wesmoit is going to, uh, hastily, uh, loot, uh, Scrabble's ports.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Grab this, uh…

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:32.000
GM: Okay, so, hold on, you wanna see what's in this room?

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
GM: Before you actually start moving around.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um… yeah, actually, yes, that's a good point. Yeah, I'll take a few steps and then pause.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
GM: Bye.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: to look around.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:45.000
GM: Alright. In the center of this room is dominated by a raised pool.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:50.000
GM: of a viscous green fluid. It stews and boils.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:56.000
GM: Um, the scent of it burns your nostrils, and your eyes are watering.

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:04.000
GM: And the south wall is covered with three crude bas-relief carvings, uh, depicting a man being consumed by ooze.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:10.000
GM: Um, they kind of remind you of those statues that you saw over.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:13.000
GM: in that room there. Um…

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Right, right, right.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.000
GM: And you see, uh, this person…

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:21.000
GM: Here, in the corner, uh, and…

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
GM: Wait a second…

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:37.000
GM: Yeah, I don't know where those things came from, they don't belong here.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, I'm sorry, that… that…

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I was trying to strip, uh…

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Scrabble earlier. That was… that was my fault.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:46.000
GM: Oh, oh, oh, okay, so you need, uh…

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:49.000
GM: That was what… what did I just toss? It was a flint and steel…

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, Flint and steel, and…

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
GM: clarifying hook.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And a grappling hook.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:58.000
GM: Alright, so you get the flint and steel…

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
GM: You get the grappling hook…

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
GM: Uh, do you want the pole on the club, too?

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Sure, or why not?

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:19.000
GM: Uh, okay, so what do I do? Can I give this…

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, or if you want to just delete those, I'll just grab them from the inventory, uh, from the compendium, it's fine.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So, no big deal.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:48.000
GM: Well, I can… I can get it right here. I was trying to make the item pile work, I don't know why they don't, but… so there's your poll.

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Okay.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
GM: And here's your club.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Okay.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And, uh, Scrabble had a few bones, uh, as well, that he had collected from the grate.

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: In the earlier room. Uh, so WASMOT is going to toss those into this, uh, bubbling fountain of viscous lime.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
GM: Alright, so, okay, so you…

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
GM: Um…

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
GM: So you throw the bones into that pool.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.000
GM: Alright, so the bones go in.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:37.000
GM: And they… they hiss and sink and are dissolving as that happens. The level of the slime in the pool.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
GM: Ooh, starts to lower.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Ooh.

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:42.000
GM: And then stops, so it…

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:46.000
GM: Sank down a little bit, um, when you did that.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: We just need these…

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Second sacrifice.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Actually, I'm just gonna grab Scrabble's bottom.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Tell me if this is too much for an actor.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
GM: Yeah, this is… that was your…

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm just gonna toss…

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:05.000
GM: You… that would be your action. You're kind of done now, so it'll be Garm's turn.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Okay. Okay.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Okay, that's good. Yeah, yeah, right.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Garm/Loren: This is me.

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Toss Scrabble's body in the slime pit.

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
Garm/Loren: Scrabble died in here?

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:42.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, I mean, you're basically standing on his corpse, so…

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Travel is bad.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
GM: Do you?

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Awesome in response to it.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Like, we did the first sacrifice, bone.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And something interesting happens, so…

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Let's… let's do…

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: It's do flesh.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Scrabble's past Carrie.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Garm/Loren: My grandma looked down on the side.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Garm/Loren: Or whatever it is. Stairs?

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
GM: Um…

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:37.000
GM: It, uh… let me see…

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
GM: Yeah, it's just a dead end.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Garm/Loren: Is this… is… is this the markings on the ground? Do they represent different…

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Garm/Loren: Still in the works?

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
GM: Oh.

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:12.000
GM: Does it… uh, no, that… yeah, it's just like stone.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
GM: Nothing. It's just…

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:18.000
Garm/Loren: There's no, like, it's not going up or down or anything.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:22.000
GM: No, no, no, it's just, uh, just that the passage goes that way and just sort of dead ends.

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:26.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, uh, Garm is gonna tap…

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Garm/Loren: On the wall here, and listen for hollow spaces.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
GM: Mhm.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:33.000
GM: Uh, you don't hear anything.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.000
Garm/Loren: Thinking maybe there could be some sort of an empty room.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah. Okay. Alright.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
GM: Sounds pretty solid.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
GM: Is that Garm's turn?

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Garm/Loren: Mhm.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:49.000
GM: Alright, Marlette, so you have this new person that you have never seen before.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
GM: Sitting in the corner.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Hi.

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Um… I also don't see more or less…

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Character sheet, like, it's, uh…

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
GM: Bo…

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Neither of them.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
GM: I think, yeah, let me…

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
GM: Okay…

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay. Here.

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
GM: Now you can see him?

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yep.

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:31.000
GM: Alright.

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Excellent.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:39.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So, we haven't tossed anything else, uh…

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:42.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Other than the bone… just the bones.

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
GM: Just a bone.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Um…

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
Ulara/Valaxis: We've got a couple of dead bodies here.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, yeah, like, uh, I'd say let's throw…

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Uh…

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:57.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, did we loot… did you guys loot Philomena completely? Like, uh…

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Or, like, is there some?

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:01.000
GM: Uh, no, Philomena still has…

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:08.000
GM: Club, Flint and Steel, and a pole.

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Actually, like, I might take those.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: But that… that…

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:23.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: That would count as my action, I suppose. Like, I just have a rope.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So…

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, grab those. Do you want a dagger as well?

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I would like…

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: No, the…

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: from what I understand, like.

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Are you saying that if I want your dagger?

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes, I have two daggers at the moment, so…

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Why not? Yeah, like, so I have something with range.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And do you know your way out of this place?

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:52.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sure.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Of course!

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
Garm/Loren: For but a school fee!

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yes, like…

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:05.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I don't know, like, this guy sounds like Astarion to me.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
GM: Alright, sat ahead for more of that?

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:12.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I suppose, like, that's my action, right? Yeah, so…

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
GM: Yeah. Alara?

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: So, I will come in here…

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:22.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Oh, does Philomena's body go into the pool already?

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:25.000
GM: No. You want to have a stuffer in there?

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:30.000
GM: Alright, heave her body up into the pool.

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:35.000
GM: And she sinks, and if flesh is sizzling and is eaten from her bones.

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:39.000
GM: Um, disappearing, um, and she's gone.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:45.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And does the acid level go down or anything?

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
GM: It does not.

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Hmm. Okay.

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
Ulara/Valaxis: But I'll ask, uh…

03:06:58.000 --> 03:06:59.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, our, our new person.

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Hear who they are, and…

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
Ulara/Valaxis: then pass them off to Dagger.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
Ulara/Valaxis: As well, so…

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I can drop a dagger from my…

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
GM: Here, I'll just, um…

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
GM: Transferred over.

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
GM: There we go.

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:25.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And then I'll… actually, if I've got any time left, I'll look…

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: You said there was, uh, bow-relief?

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Over here for, of a…

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh…

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:35.000
GM: Yeah, it's, uh, the, uh, the, the…

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:40.000
GM: It's a bas-reliefs that depict a man being consumed by ooze.

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:44.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will look around that for secret doors.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:48.000
GM: Alright, um, you don't find anything.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
GM: Is that it?

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, yeah, that should be a full turn there.

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:10.000
GM: Alright, so… Born.

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 1, 2, 3…

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Fox…

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Born/Calgalcandar: What do I see?

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:28.000
GM: Let's see, UC… yes, um…

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:32.000
GM: Right here are two…

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:36.000
GM: Um, massive double doors made of tarnished bronze.

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
GM: Um…

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:46.000
GM: You can't really see them, but uh… the light that's being cast, you know, there's flickering light, so it looks like there's a light source over here somewhere and over here somewhere.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:48.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
GM: Um…

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um, I will go ahead and do a double move.

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
Born/Calgalcandar: And…

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
GM: Okay…

03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:00.000
GM: So as you get closer, um, you are able to make out.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:06.000
GM: Um, some words written across the top of those large bronze doors.

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Mhm.

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:11.000
GM: And they… it… what's written there is, uh, the word.

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:15.000
GM: Speak devotion to the Slime Lord and pass.

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
GM: And…

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:25.000
GM: Uh… and you see some worn letters or symbols have been scratched into the floor.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
GM: Ps, yeah, and um…

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
GM: Yeah, so attached to the wall here…

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:39.000
GM: And here are two sconces.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
GM: Um, with torches in them.

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Mhm.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:51.000
GM: And in the middle of the floor, it looks like there was something had been scratched into the floor, like some words or whatever, but.

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:54.000
GM: They've, um, um…

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:59.000
GM: like, something that was hastily removed. Um…

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
GM: And…

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000
GM: Let's see what else…

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:11.000
GM: The doors, you notice, they depict relief, uh, um…

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:16.000
GM: Uh, relief images of horrific scenes of cultists who are devouring.

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:19.000
GM: Uh, and being dissolved by ooze.

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
GM: Um…

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, that's nice.

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
GM: Yup, and that's… that's what you see from there.

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Um… let's see…

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… yeah.

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Cow will move.

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Ugh, come on.

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000
Born/Calgalcandar: There. Alright.

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:54.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, yeah, that's it for me, that's a double move.

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.000
GM: Okay. WASMED.

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:07.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Hmm…

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So, Philomena's body, the flesh was consumed, but nothing…

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: The, the level of slime…

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: strange.

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000
GM: Nope, did not.

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That is annoying. That is…

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Extremely annoying.

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:27.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, alright, well…

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:31.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm gonna test a theory, and uh…

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh…

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: uh…

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: You know, carve, uh, a little bit of, uh.

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:45.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, flesh off the back of my hand and toss it in the, uh…

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, uh, swine pit.

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:56.000
GM: Alright, you take one point of damage, and as you drop your little gobbet of flesh.

03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:02.000
GM: Um, the ooze consumes it, and the level of the, uh, ooze, uh.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:05.000
GM: Drops, uh, a little bit more.

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:12.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So, couldn't have been dead, had to be living, alright.

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um… that suggests that if…

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Someone sacrifices themselves and plunges into the.

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Pit alive, that it will drain fully, and something valuable will be revealed.

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:35.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So, I need to… all of you to look deeply within your own souls.

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:38.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And decide who's gonna leap into the pit.

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:43.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Whereupon, promptly, a rude gesture is made in your general direction.

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.000
GM: Uh, it's Garm's turn.

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000
Garm/Loren: Grandma's gonna check out…

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
Garm/Loren: This hallway.

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
GM: Yeah, it looks like it just sort of dead ends.

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:10.000
Garm/Loren: Oops.

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:16.000
Garm/Loren: Okay. Look for secret doors.

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
GM: How do you look?

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000
Garm/Loren: Uh…

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:27.000
Garm/Loren: If the pattern on the floor is anything to go by, like, step on each of the bricks to try to trigger them.

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:31.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, and then tap on the wall to listen for hollow spaces.

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:35.000
Garm/Loren: Um, I, like, feel along the wall for seams.

03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:38.000
GM: Where are you tapping?

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:44.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, I'd start on this wall and go around with my right hand.

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:51.000
GM: Okay, uh, when you tap over in this direction, or this area here, it sounds kind of like…

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:53.000
GM: different.

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:56.000
Garm/Loren: That was right… right here.

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
GM: Yeah.

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:04.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, Garm will take out his crowbar.

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.000
Garm/Loren: And start, uh, kind of…

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:11.000
Garm/Loren: Poking it into the wall here and there to see if he can get, like, leverage.

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:15.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, on anything? Maybe if it's a false wall?

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:22.000
GM: Okay, uh, from what you can tell, I mean, there's nothing that really can get purchased on it. It looks like the rest of the wall.

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:27.000
GM: It just looks like a stone… stone wall.

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:35.000
Garm/Loren: Alright, this might be the other side, might be, like, a one-way secret door.

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:40.000
Garm/Loren: Okay. Garm will come back out and let the party know what he found.

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:42.000
GM: Alright, Morlette?

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:50.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I go on the northern walls and tap here and here.

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: To see if there is.

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000
GM: Nope, you don't hear anything.

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Okay.

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000
GM: Loren?

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I am gonna go back into that little…

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000
Ulara/Valaxis: uh, corridor.

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And…

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I'm gonna be looking for…

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, anything on the floor that…

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Blocks that look a little different, blocks that.

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:27.000
Ulara/Valaxis: give, I will be prodding from a distance with my pole.

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:32.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, and not just standing over them in case things… they set off a trap, so…

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:37.000
GM: Okay, um, you, you tap around, look around, um, you don't…

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
GM: Don't find anything.

03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:42.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay, now I'll move back, you know, do that section, and…

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Do this section as well, so…

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:49.000
GM: Yep, nothing seems, uh, out of the ordinary.

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:52.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000
GM: Alright, um…

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000
GM: Born.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:17.000
Born/Calgalcandar: What was the text on the door again?

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:23.000
GM: Uh, that says, Speak Devotion to the Slime Lord and pass.

03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:28.000
GM: Paste it in the chat again.

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Where is this door?

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.000
GM: You can't see it.

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:36.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay.

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:39.000
Garm/Loren: Is this… is this character supposed to be hostile? Am I supposed to be seeing this?

03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:43.000
Ulara/Valaxis: That's my character, Laru.

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, it is…

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Dad?

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.000
GM: Wait, what?

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:48.000
Garm/Loren: I think its disposition is hostile. I see, like, a red…

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000
Garm/Loren: finger edit. Is that normal?

03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000
GM: Around Lara's character?

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.000
GM: Um… hmm…

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah.

03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:00.000
GM: Oh, does say hostel. That's weird.

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Aha!

03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:09.000
GM: Oh.

03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:11.000
GM: Everybody's hostile.

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:17.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oh, the truth comes out.

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.000
Garm/Loren: The whole time!

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:25.000
Garm/Loren: The acid was coming from inside the house.

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:38.000
GM: Now, everybody should be friendly.

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000
GM: Uh, and uh, so what is Born doing?

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, Born will try the door.

03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:09.000
GM: Mmm, the door seems to be quite securely locked.

03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:16.000
Born/Calgalcandar: But does it seem to have any sort of…

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000
Born/Calgalcandar: opening or anything.

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:28.000
GM: Um, no, I mean, it's got the same down the middle where the two doors meet, but beyond that, nothing.

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:31.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, no lock or anything like that.

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:32.000
GM: No. Nope.

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:04.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Calgalcander will approach the door.

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:09.000
Born/Calgalcandar: and swear devotion to the Slime Lord.

03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:12.000
GM: Okay, what are the words exactly?

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:25.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Have we seen this Limelord by name anywhere else in the dungeon?

03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:28.000
GM: No. Well, you… you…

03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:31.000
GM: Uh, when you first fell into the pit, written above there.

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:35.000
GM: Was those, um, engraved into the archway.

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:38.000
GM: On the thing leading out was…

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:43.000
GM: This carving, welcome to dissolution, Escape, or Feed Raka Uku.

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh, then Calgalcander will speak…

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:56.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Kyle will swear devotion to, uh, I can't pronounce it myself, but that name.

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.000
GM: Alright, what exact words does Calgalcander say?

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:04.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:10.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I swear devotion to, uh, the…

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:13.000
Born/Calgalcandar: The… that.

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:12.000
GM: Rakaoku.

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:14.000
GM: Okay.

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:20.000
GM: And his words echo in the chamber, um, but nothing seems to happen.

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hmm.

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:44.000
GM: Anything else?

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:46.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I think that's it for me.

03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:48.000
GM: Was it?

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:57.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I just… I really think we need to do something with this, uh…

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Something further with this slime pit.

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:06.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I don't suppose there's a convenient, like.

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Like, rats scurrying around the room or anything like that.

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: some living creature that I could… that I could hurl into the swag pit.

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000
GM: Nope.

03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That is…

03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: really annoying.

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm just… I'm convinced that.

03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:33.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: If we could throw a living being into the slime pit.

03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:39.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: The… the slime will… will finally drain out, and something significant will be.

03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:42.000
Born/Calgalcandar: You're… you're surrounded by living beings.

03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:46.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah…

03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:50.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: You know, I thought about that. I'm thinking about it right this second.

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:53.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh…

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:57.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I don't… I don't think that would go over real well.

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:05.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm also thinking about the fact that Wasbo himself is a living being.

03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:08.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Go take a dive.

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And I… and also wounded, by the way, so…

03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yes, right, that's 50%, uh, so…

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um…

03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:26.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Personal survival, or survival of the group?

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:31.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: It's most important. Dive in myself, or try to hurl, uh…

03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:33.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, whorl it into this one, good.

03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:37.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Which of those two options?

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:43.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: You are close to me, and you seem to be smaller and hopefully weaker than me.

03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Well, it's, uh, more or less is an L.

03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, the image is not, uh…

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, it doesn't quite line up with the… yeah, yeah.

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Super. Yeah, yeah.

03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:56.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: No, that would be, uh…

03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:58.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That would be a really bad…

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:02.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Fun to think about, but hard to do. Um…

03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Whoa…

03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Alright, I'm just gonna…

03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: This is… we'll put a PIN in this. We need to come back to this slide, but this is really important.

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:27.000
Garm/Loren: Well, it says we need to speak.

03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:30.000
Garm/Loren: Right? Did we try just speaking?

03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:32.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: No, no, it was…

03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:38.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, remember, the first sacrifice was bone, the second was flesh, the third was all.

03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:42.000
Born/Calgalcandar: No, the first was flesh, then it's bone.

03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:40.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So…

03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:45.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well, whatever. I mean, we did the first two correctly.

03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:48.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: The bones made the level drop.

03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:51.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: The flash made the level drop even more.

03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm assuming all means an entire living being.

03:23:56.000 --> 03:24:00.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Um, but there are no convenient rats or anything like that.

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:03.000
Born/Calgalcandar: You have…

03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Plenty of living beings to sacrifice.

03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:10.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Or… why… maybe, I mean, like, uh, we can wait for…

03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: uh, an encounter…

03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:15.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And maybe push, uh…

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I don't know, like, it's, uh…

03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, it's just, you know…

03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:26.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: It was difficult and extremely painful to get here.

03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And, uh…

03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:34.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And we got a super interesting reaction when we started doing the sacrifices.

03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:38.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: It's just we're really hung up on this third one.

03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:40.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Mhm.

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hi, I direct your attention to the scroll we came across earlier.

03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:48.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, right.

03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:56.000
Born/Calgalcandar: The first two offerings are backed up, but I don't think we could live with ourselves if we made the third offering.

03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:50.000
Garm/Loren: scroll of Birmingham.

03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:00.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Well, I mean, that individual's, you know.

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: ethical…

03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:08.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Quandaries are not necessarily my ethical quandaries.

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:11.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mm-hmm. Although we weren't allowed to bring, uh, chaotic.

03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:15.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Characters a lie, who might find it much easier.

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000
Ulara/Valaxis: to, uh…

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:18.000
Garm/Loren: Do we wanna just, like, roll…

03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:22.000
Garm/Loren: Have, like, a roll-off, and whoever rolls the lowest.

03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:24.000
Garm/Loren: Has to sacrifice a character into the pit.

03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:25.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, draws the shorts strong? Yeah, I'm down with that.

03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I'm done with that.

03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:31.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Well, before we try that, um…

03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:37.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Let's… all the characters think about if they've…

03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:42.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Ever heard of a name for a slime lord or anything like that.

03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:44.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Other than this, uh, Raka Uku.

03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:48.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Um…

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000
Garm/Loren: Was there a…

03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000
Garm/Loren: A keyhole in the wall.

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:54.000
Garm/Loren: Over here, is we found that key that we haven't found a use for yet.

03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:54.000
GM: Nope.

03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:56.000
GM: There was not.

03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:01.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: By the way, like, the scroll that we found, uh…

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Here, like, in the…

03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:04.000
Garm/Loren: Over here, it was Burning Hands.

03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:06.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay, okay.

03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:10.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: So, we think at the end of this.

03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:15.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: little southeastern corridor. There's probably a secret door, but we can't open it from this side.

03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:19.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah, we might have to, like, bash down the wall or something.

03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: What we're guessing.

03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, or…

03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:24.000
Garm/Loren: like, actually take it apart, but I don't… I don't have a sledgehammer.

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000
GM: Oh!

03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:30.000
GM: Um… interesting.

03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:38.000
GM: Um…

03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.000
GM: This was rather fortuitous.

03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:45.000
GM: Hold on a second here…

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:57.000
Garm/Loren: Is there an old, decrepit hobbit who comes by, who's like…

03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:01.000
Garm/Loren: I have terminal cancer. Kill me, please.

03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:03.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, I have nothing to live for.

03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:08.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, what is it? Oh, rats.

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:11.000
Garm/Loren: Ooh.

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:12.000
GM: Literally completely random, showed up.

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Ask and you shall receive.

03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:18.000
GM: I rolled an encounter check, and that's what it actually came up with, so…

03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000
Garm/Loren: animal experimentation…

03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000
GM: Um, so yeah, so…

03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:24.000
GM: Two rats come scurrying through this room, um…

03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Dex check to grab one?

03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:36.000
GM: Uh, everybody, let's do this, um…

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000
GM: Everybody Roll Initiative.

03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:00.000
Garm/Loren: Wow, a lot of net 20s!

03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:04.000
GM: Wow, okay, so…

03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:06.000
Garm/Loren: Stuff.

03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:26.000
GM: So I think, uh, Ullara had the, uh, advantage there.

03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:31.000
GM: So, Ulara gets to go first.

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will…

03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:36.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I guess…

03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:40.000
Ulara/Valaxis: We don't want to kill it, so I can't stab it first, so, um…

03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:48.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Can I try to knock the thing out, or just try… well, I suppose try to grab it.

03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:50.000
Ulara/Valaxis: If these things are small enough.

03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:52.000
GM: Yeah.

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:56.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Grab and then toss it into… and toss it into the, uh, acid pit.

03:28:56.000 --> 03:29:03.000
GM: You can, yeah, you can see a couple things. You could try to grab it and toss it, that would be a posed dex check.

03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:08.000
GM: Uh, if you wanted to try to whack it with something and knock it out, then that would be, like, a melee attack.

03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:15.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I'll try to knock it out with the, uh…

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:18.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, the, the pommel of the dagger.

03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:22.000
GM: Okay. That's gonna be a…

03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:24.000
GM: Regular melee attack.

03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:35.000
GM: Uh… which, in fact, actually hits.

03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Gay.

03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:43.000
GM: And that makes it…

03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:47.000
GM: Oh, let's see, let's do…

03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:54.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Does that knock it out?

03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:56.000
GM: It does.

03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:03.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Can I toss it into the acid as far as…

03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:02.000
GM: It's a great head.

03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:06.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Still on the turn, or have I just used everything up?

03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:10.000
GM: Yeah, hold on, there's, um, let me check something.

03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:20.000
GM: Here we go.

03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:31.000
GM: There, it's unconscious.

03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:38.000
GM: Um, yeah, so okay, so your attack was to whack it, you knocked it out, um…

03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:41.000
GM: it would now be… Garm's turn.

03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:45.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And guys, notice one of our torches just went out.

03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Oops.

03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:02.000
GM: Garm's to Garm's turn.

03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:04.000
Garm/Loren: Is this one grappled?

03:31:04.000 --> 03:31:06.000
GM: That one is unconscious.

03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:08.000
Garm/Loren: Okay.

03:31:38.000 --> 03:31:40.000
GM: What's Garm gonna do?

03:31:44.000 --> 03:31:46.000
Garm/Loren: Uh…

03:31:50.000 --> 03:31:53.000
Garm/Loren: We'll go up and throw the unconscious rat.

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:55.000
Garm/Loren: Into the… pit.

03:31:56.000 --> 03:31:58.000
GM: Okay.

03:31:58.000 --> 03:32:02.000
GM: So as you do that, um, a couple of things happen.

03:32:02.000 --> 03:32:08.000
GM: Um, the level of the slime in the pool begins to go down.

03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:11.000
GM: Simultaneously.

03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:14.000
GM: You hear a, uh, st… uh, uh…

03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:18.000
GM: As if a door opened.

03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:22.000
GM: And as the slime drains from the pool.

03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:28.000
GM: Uh, you see some words, uh, written.

03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:31.000
GM: Um, at the bottom.

03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:34.000
GM: They're revealed as the slime drains away, and that's what you see.

03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:45.000
GM: O slime lord, open the way before us, dissolve us in thine glutinous glory.

03:32:54.000 --> 03:32:56.000
GM: Is Garm doing anything else?

03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:00.000
Garm/Loren: Uh, do I have an action, or was Tossit my action?

03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:03.000
GM: Uh, it's tossing… picking up, tossing with that menu action.

03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:08.000
Garm/Loren: Okay, I will cry out, O Slime Lord, open the way before us, dissolve us in thine glutinous glory.

03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:13.000
GM: Alright, do you cry it out? Nothing appears to happen, and more like it.

03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: We are out of torch, so, like, I'm in the darkness, I believe.

03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:20.000
GM: Oh, yeah, you just plunged into darkness.

03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:23.000
Ulara/Valaxis: But there's… we see the light ahead of us through the doorway.

03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:26.000
GM: Hm?

03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:28.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Do we see that light ahead of us through the doorway?

03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:35.000
GM: Um, you see some light. They don't have a torch over there either, but that doesn't illuminate where you are. Um, you're still considered in darkness.

03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:41.000
GM: You can see some light coming through the passage, but it's not illuminating this room, so you are all in darkness.

03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:43.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah, we… we can stagger down that way and light a torch.

03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:46.000
Ulara/Valaxis: in the light. Hopefully.

03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:55.000
GM: So, more or less, you do not see that light. You're… you're in pitch black.

03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:01.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Interesting.

03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:05.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Um…

03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:07.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I guess, uh…

03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:15.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I go in the general direction of where the second rat was.

03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:18.000
GM: Okay.

03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Based on my memory, and I…

03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:21.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Wing my… club.

03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:23.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Around the train to hit.

03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:27.000
GM: Alright, uh, Milai Tech Disadvantage.

03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:26.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Eat.

03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Sure.

03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: With minus 2.

03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:39.000
GM: Nope, you hear a squeak?

03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:42.000
GM: Um, but you don't connect with anything.

03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:45.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Alright…

03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:46.000
GM: And…

03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:49.000
GM: Born.

03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:54.000
Born/Calgalcandar: So, did we hear them shouting out this phrase?

03:34:54.000 --> 03:35:01.000
GM: Uh, I'd say you probably heard some shouting, uh, you probably weren't able to pick up exactly all the words.

03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:10.000
GM: But you do notice… well, actually, you don't notice that the door is open, because you are in the light of these braziers. You can't see beyond that, though.

03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:12.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yeah.

03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:19.000
GM: You heard a sound as if a door opened, but you didn't see anything.

03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:26.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Well, this is a pickle.

03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:29.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh…

03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:41.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Let's see…

03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.000
Born/Calgalcandar: He has a rope.

03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:06.000
Born/Calgalcandar: And the light from the bridge is yours.

03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:11.000
GM: They're not braziers, they're sconces on the wall.

03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:18.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay. And… how are… how are they providing light?

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:21.000
GM: Um, with a flame burning.

03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:25.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, but it's… it…

03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:28.000
Born/Calgalcandar: It's not something I could take out.

03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:31.000
GM: Oh, I'm sure you probably…

03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:34.000
GM: Workday, you could probably get him off the wall.

03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:43.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay. Uh, Born will try to take one of these off the wall.

03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:48.000
GM: Alright, um, you…

03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:56.000
GM: Uh, pull and tug and grunt a bit, but, uh, ultimately you manage to pull it off.

03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:59.000
GM: And, um…

03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:02.000
GM: It.

03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.000
GM: Hold on here, let me…

03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:42.000
GM: Hmm, how do we do this?

03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:45.000
GM: There's gotta be a way to do this. There we go.

03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:48.000
GM: No, that doesn't do it.

03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:53.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Just, uh, give me a lit torch or something?

03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:58.000
GM: It gives you a torch, but it's a torch that is diminished in terms of its brightness.

03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:05.000
GM: Uh… but I don't…

03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:14.000
GM: I can't actually see a way to…

03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:18.000
GM: Change that?

03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:30.000
GM: Huh.

03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:33.000
GM: Oh, well.

03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:42.000
GM: Yeah, so you've got…

03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:46.000
GM: Where you don't? Where did it go? I gave you a torch.

03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:56.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay, it shows it lit.

03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:58.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Uh… oh, there it goes.

03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:01.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Hello.

03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:04.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Okay.

03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:08.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I will… okay, so I lit a torch…

03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:13.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Or I pull it off the wall, so I can only move 30 feet.

03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:17.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 1, 2, 3…

03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:20.000
Born/Calgalcandar: 4… 5…

03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:23.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Six…

03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:27.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Don't think… move…

03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:32.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Up to here.

03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:36.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Yep. Oh, good lord, okay.

03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:40.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Right there. Hey!

03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:43.000
GM: All these people I abandoned!

03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:48.000
Born/Calgalcandar: And I think it can move… yeah.

03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:50.000
Born/Calgalcandar: More. Alright, there we go.

03:39:55.000 --> 03:40:00.000
GM: Um, let's see… that rat is going to try to bite…

03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:03.000
GM: moralette back after that.

03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:06.000
GM: attack…

03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:09.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Attack, quote-unquote.

03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:16.000
GM: Let's see… Morla, what's your A/C? Oh, only 8? Yeah, that hits, um…

03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Aww.

03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:19.000
GM: It was nice knowing you, Moralette.

03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:22.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, I could have just…

03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:23.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Killed by a rat.

03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:25.000
Born/Calgalcandar: The rat's gonna kill everybody.

03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:26.000
Garm/Loren: The faint of…

03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:29.000
Garm/Loren: State of many an adventurous.

03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:29.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: That's like…

03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:31.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I may need another cast now.

03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:33.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Like, the last one?

03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:39.000
GM: This is your last PC that's, um…

03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:43.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Thank you.

03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:45.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I think Kilo.

03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:57.000
GM: What's your PC left?

03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: It's, uh, Ein Kill or Enkil, like with, uh, starting with an E.

03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.000
GM: Ankyl, okay, gotcha.

03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:06.000
GM: Make sure you're configured as the owner.

03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: If I'd known this is what…

03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:23.000
GM: How about we say that Ein Kil just appeared right in this passage?

03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:27.000
GM: They must have threw somebody else down.

03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:26.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: And he died because of, uh…

03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:30.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: We died because of acid, or no?

03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:33.000
GM: You managed to, yeah, dodge the acid, and…

03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:38.000
GM: And you, uh, show up behind the party.

03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:52.000
GM: And then let's add Ein Kill to the tracker.

03:41:56.000 --> 03:41:59.000
GM: No, IKO will have the same, um…

03:41:58.000 --> 03:42:00.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, okay, okay.

03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:02.000
GM: Oh, and you rolled the same, so it doesn't matter.

03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:04.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Awesome.

03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:08.000
GM: Okay, and…

03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:11.000
GM: Wasn't wet.

03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:14.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, well…

03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:17.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: It's a shame that Morlett had to die.

03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:21.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: If I'd known this was his fate, I would have actually tried to.

03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:24.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Throw him into the slime pit several rounds ago.

03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:30.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, he would have thrown himself, probably, as well.

03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:32.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Seeing the, um…

03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:36.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Light erupting from the southeastern passage.

03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:39.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Uh, I'm just gonna race for, uh…

03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:47.000
GM: Alright.

03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: I will attempt to kill the other rat.

03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:57.000
GM: Sounds good.

03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:05.000
GM: It's… it's dead.

03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:08.000
Ulara/Valaxis: And then if I can, I will grab…

03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:11.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh, more or let by his collar and drag him.

03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:14.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Uh…

03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Off on the… the floor here.

03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:19.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Towards the… towards the light.

03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.000
GM: Alright.

03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:33.000
GM: Garm?

03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:40.000
Garm/Loren: Looks like we're done here.

03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:45.000
Garm/Loren: Huh?

03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:49.000
GM: Alright, how about we say that everybody regroups in this big room here?

03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:51.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yep.

03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:51.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: was good.

03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:54.000
GM: Alright, and I'm gonna suggest that we may…

03:43:54.000 --> 03:44:00.000
GM: want to call this for tonight, uh, if for no other reason I have a 6am meeting tomorrow, and…

03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:01.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Ooh.

03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, that's true.

03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:03.000
GM: I need to get to bed.

03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:04.000
Garm/Loren: Yeah, absolutely.

03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:09.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, was thinking about suggesting that very thing. It's…

03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:14.000
GM: Okay, uh, is everybody gonna be available, uh…

03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:17.000
GM: Next week? I mean, 2 weeks?

03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:17.000
Garm/Loren: Two weeks?

03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:19.000
Garm/Loren: Yep.

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yes.

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yep.

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, should not be a problem.

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000
GM: Product Mike.

03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:24.000
GM: What is that? It's October 1st. Okay, yep.

03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000
GM: Cool.

03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:30.000
GM: Um, then we can… is… is… how's this gauntlet been going?

03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:33.000
GM: You're… nobody was dying, but now all of a sudden, everybody's dying.

03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:37.000
Garm/Loren: I mean, none of my guys have died, so I'm happy that some of the… yeah, the environmental stuff was, like.

03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:44.000
Garm/Loren: We can weather some of that, but, like, we have shed a lot of characters so far.

03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:46.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah.

03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000
Garm/Loren: We're, we're churning through our records.

03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:52.000
Born/Calgalcandar: I don't know what you're talking about! I ran away from the corridor of death, and I've been…

03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:53.000
Garm/Loren: Bravely ran away.

03:44:54.000 --> 03:45:01.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, I've… I've run this a couple times, so it's fun to actually see it from the other side, and actually play it.

03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:06.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Oh, wow. Like, can you suspend your, uh…

03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:08.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: disbelief, like…

03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:11.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, yeah, it's not a problem. It's also been a while since I last ran it, so…

03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:13.000
Garm/Loren: Hmm.

03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:13.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: I don't remember, uh…

03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:16.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, a lot of the details, so that's…

03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:24.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, I was crushed, but, like, that's a gauntlet, right? So it was a lot of fun, I suppose.

03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000
GM: What happens?

03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:26.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah.

03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:30.000
GM: It ain't fun until people start dropping like flies.

03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:36.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: And invariably, in something like this, you, you…

03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:41.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: everybody, like, every… the couple times I ran this.

03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:48.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: we had those Keystone Cops moments, like we did with the torches and the flint and steel and stuff.

03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:49.000
GM: Mhm.

03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:52.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Where just nothing goes right for a really long time.

03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:54.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah…

03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:55.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Everybody gets increasingly desperate.

03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:55.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yeah.

03:45:57.000 --> 03:46:02.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Yeah, like, it's, uh… I had the same thing when I ran a…

03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:07.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: A gauntlet as well, like, uh, like, earlier this summer, and uh…

03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:13.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I don't know, like, it's, uh… yeah, you kind of have to hand-wave something at some point, because…

03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:18.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Otherwise, like, it gets stuck, right?

03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:19.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Yeah, yeah.

03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:20.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: So…

03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Mhm.

03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:26.000
GM: All right, folks, well, I'm going to bed, so have a good one, thank you all for playing, and uh…

03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:23.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Brilliant.

03:46:25.000 --> 03:46:28.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Oh, thanks for running it. Yeah, it's a…

03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:30.000
GM: We'll see some of you next week, and others in two weeks.

03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:28.000
Garm/Loren: Thanks for having it!

03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:29.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: True.

03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:29.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Bernie?

03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:32.000
Garm/Loren: Ready? Bye-bye, everyone.

03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:36.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Yep. And when we get back, we'll loot, uh, loot a body there, so…

03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:34.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Great. Have a great night.

03:46:38.000 --> 03:46:41.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: I need some gear, by the way, so…

03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Well, that's why I grabbed the body and lawn, so…

03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:47.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Thank you, thank you so much. Have a good night!

03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:46.000
GM: All right. Good night, everyone.

03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:47.000
Ulara/Valaxis: Okay. Good night.

03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:49.000
Born/Calgalcandar: Bye.

03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:49.000
Scrabble/Wasmoët: Goodnight.

03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:50.000
Philomena/Sirzig/Morelet/Einkil: Good night.
